Only recently I made my Address [to the Federal Assembly]. Honestly speaking,
I do not know what else to add to what I said then. I believe I covered all the key points.</p><p>Nevertheless, there must be issues,
which you want us to clarify. When I say ‘us’, I am referring to my colleagues
in the Presidential Executive Office and the Government Cabinet and myself.</p><p>Therefore, I suggest that we skip
any lengthy monologues and get right down to your questions so as not to waste
time.</p><p>Mr Peskov, please.</p><p><b>Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov</b>: Last year we started a good tradition by beginning the press conference with a question from one of the most experienced
members of the Kremlin’s press pool, Vyacheslav Terekhov. However, we have another
press pool old-timer, Alexander Gamov from the <i>Komsomolskaya Pravda</i>. I would like to give him the opportunity to ask the first question.</p><p><b>Alexander Gamov</b>: Thank you very much Mr President, for your 11<sup>th</sup> press
conference of this kind.</p><p>Here is my question. Before coming
here, I reread the transcript of your last year’s press conference, and there
we also discussed the difficult situation developing in the Russian economy.
When Vyacheslav Terekhov and our other colleagues asked you then how long it
would take to get over this complicated situation, you said in the worst case
scenario this would take a year or two. These were your words. I am sure you
remember them. This means this would be roughly late 2016 – early 2017.</p><p>Could you please tell us if your
feelings regarding our economic recovery have changed? The country is going
through very hard times, and you know this better than we do. What is your
forecast for the future?</p><p>Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself:
Alexander Gamov, <i>Komsomolskaya Pravda</i> – radio station, website and newspaper. Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
To begin with, I will tell you a very old joke.</p><p>Two friends meet and one asks the other: ”How are you?“ The other says: ”My life is all stripes – black stripes
followed by white ones.“ – ”So which one is it now?“ – ”Now I’m in the black one.“ Another six months pass, they meet
again: ”How’s life? I know it’s all
stripes, but which one is it now?“ – ”It’s black now.“ – ”But it was black last time!“ – ”Looks like it was white last time.“</p><p>We are having something very
similar.</p><p>When a year ago we spoke of our
plans and how we would move ahead to recover from the crisis, about our
prospects, we, knowing that unfortunately our economy is very dependent on foreign economic factors, mainly the prices for our traditional exports like oil
and gas, petroleum products and chemicals, which are all calculated based on oil
and gas prices, proceeded from the idea that the average price of Brent, our
crude oil, would be around $100 a barrel.</p><p>This was in early 2014. We used this
figure in all our further calculations of macroeconomic parameters, revenue and spending, and social support and support for the economy, and late last year
the Economic Development Ministry built its development plans proceeding from
these figures. However, by the end of this year we had to rerun all our
calculations, and even last year we had to do this as oil prices fell almost by half, not by some percentage, but by half from $100 a barrel to $50.</p><p>We calculated the budget for next
year based on this very figure, a very optimistic one of $50 a barrel. However,
now it is what — $38? Therefore, I believe we will have to make further
adjustments.</p><p>At the same time, I would like to use your question to demonstrate where we stand.</p><blockquote><p>Statistics
show that the Russian economy has generally overcome the crisis,
or at least the peak of the crisis, not
the crisis itself.</p></blockquote><p>Naturally, after the drop in energy
resource prices all our other figures started ‘sliding’. What are they? The GDP
has gone down by 3.7 percent. As of December 7, the inflation has reached 12.3
percent since the beginning of the year.</p><p>I find it important to say this,
because there are sure to be other questions dealing with our development
prospects and our current state of affairs. To understand these things we need
to know these figures and proceed from them.</p><p>The real disposable household income
has gone down; fixed investment has dropped by 5.7 percent over the first 10
months of the year. At the same time, as we have already said, statistics show
that the Russian economy has generally overcome the crisis, or at least the peak of the crisis, not the crisis itself.</p><p>Starting with the 2<sup>nd</sup>
quarter of this year, we have been observing signs of economic stabilisation.
What leads us to such a conclusion? In September-October the GDP grew (it is
growing already) by about 0.3–0.1 percent compared to the previous month. The volumes of industrial production stopped falling as of May. In September-October, we also had a small growth in industrial production –
0.2–0.1 percent. Incidentally, industrial production in the Far East grew by 3.1 percent.</p><p>Agriculture is demonstrating
positive dynamics with an at least 3 percent growth. This means we are doing
all the right and timely things to support agriculture. For the second year
running our grain crops exceeded 100 million tonnes – 103.4. This is very good.
I would like to use this opportunity to once again thank our agricultural
workers for their effort.</p><p>The labour market is stable, with
the unemployment rate hovering around 5.6 percent. We can see that if we look
back at 2008, this is an overall positive result of the Government’s efforts.</p><p>Our trade balance also remains
positive. The overall trade volumes have gone down, but the export surplus
remains at a rather high level of about $126.3 billion. Our international
reserves stand at $364.4 billion – this is a slight reduction, but a good
figure nevertheless.</p><p>The Russian Federation’s external
debt has gone down by 13 percent compared to 2014. Capital outflow has also
significantly dropped. Moreover, in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter we observed a net inflow.</p><p>The reduction in our debt burden is
a very important positive indicator. This is the other side dealing with the so-called sanctions. It would have been good, of course, to have access to foreign refinancing markets, so that all the money would stay in the country
and help us develop, but on the other hand over-crediting is also a bad sign.</p><p>So, what did we do? Despite all
limitations, we complied with all our commitments to our partners, including
international credit institutions. We pay everything due on time and in full.
As a result, the overall joint debt, which is not the state debt, but the total
debt of our financial institutions and companies operating in the real sector
of the economy – the overall joint debt has gone down, which is generally a very positive thing.</p><p>As I have already said, we are observing a net capital inflow, which is
also a very positive factor, and I am sure experts are saying this as well.
This means that investors, seeing the realities of our economy, are beginning
to show some interest in working here. Despite the complicated situation, the fuel and energy complex continues developing. The production of oil, coal and electricity
has grown. More than 4.6 gigawatt of new generating capacity will be
commissioned by the end of the year.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/SywBmpiIAX1AWay3OYZpnyV4hKboghTp.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/SuOt3S2AOFCJFGHwYyOVZPNRLHPUYxAZ.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(15, 16, 27);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #0f101b 0%, rgba(15,16,27,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #d2ffff 0%, rgba(210,255,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #5e80c7 0%, rgba(94,128,199,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #9a4651 0%, rgba(154,70,81,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2015-12-17"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>We have already commissioned about 20 facilities; this is somewhat
less than last year and the year before that. In the previous two years, we had
an absolute record, but 4.6 gigawatt is also very good. We will retain this
rate in the following years. This is also very important as it shows the growing capacity of the economy as a whole, its energy security.</p><p>The infrastructure is also developing actively. Russia’s entire seaport
infrastructure has grown by 19.5 million tonnes worth of capacity. I would like
to use this opportunity to draw your attention to the fact that over the January-September period the volume of cargo loaded at Russian ports went up by 3 percent. What does this mean, colleagues? Why have our budget revenues from our
export goods gone down? Because of the prices. Meanwhile, as we are observing
growing trade turnover at the ports, it means the physical volume has not gone
down but has actually increased. This is a very positive factor.</p><p>We continue developing our airport system. In the first nine months, our
airports served over 126 million passengers, which is 2.5 percent more than
last year. Internal air traffic has also grown noticeably – by more than 16
percent.</p><p>Despite the complicated financial and economic situation, we continue
our responsible state financial policy. In the 11 months of this year federal
budget revenue reached 12.2 trillion, spending – 13.1 trillion. The budget
deficit, as we can see, stands at 957 billion. The expected budget deficit by the end of the year is about 2.8 – 2.9
percent of the GDP. This is a satisfactory figure for the current economic
situation, even more than satisfactory.</p><p>To achieve a balanced federal budget this year we used our reserve fund.
At the same time, it is very important that the sovereign funds generally
remain at a healthy level of 11.8 percent of the GDP. The reserve fund amounted
to 3.931 trillion rubles, which is 5.3 percent of the GDP, while the national
welfare fund was 4.777 trillion rubles, which is 6.5 percent of the GDP.</p><p>We have complied with all our social commitments this year and are
witnessing a natural population growth. This is a very good figure that speaks
of the people’s state of mind, shows that they have the opportunity to plan
their families, which makes me very happy. Thus, 6.5 million Russian families
have received maternity capital over the entire period since the programme was
introduced. We have now extended this programme. I would like to remind you
that in 2016 maternity capital payment will remain the same as in 2015 at 453,000
rubles.</p><p>In the majority of regions, the situation with accessibility of preschool facilities has been resolved by over 97 percent.</p><p>According to the Federal State Statistics Service, life expectancy at the end of this year is forecast to exceed 71 years.</p><p>We have complied with our commitments in terms of adjusting pensions to the actual inflation in 2014, with the PAYG component increased by 11.4
percent. As of April 1 of this year, social security pensions have gone up by 10.3 percent.</p><p>You began your question by asking about last year and our expectations
for next year and the year after that. Proceeding from the current value of our
exports, the Government is expecting our economy to achieve at least a 0.7
percent growth in 2016, 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2.4 percent in 2018.</p><p>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that all our
calculations were based on the oil price of $50 a barrel. Now the price is
lower. Volatility is high. We will not rush to adjust the budget, as this would
lead to a reduction in the funding of both the social and real sectors; however,
the Government is of course working on different development scenarios. The Government should have this instrument available, to be ready for any
developments.</p><blockquote><p>Our

opportunities. We must also promote import replacement, as I said
in my Address to the Federal Assembly, which is not
a cure-all, but we believe that it will help us retool a large park
of the production sector and the agriculture industry. This
programme will enable us to introduce novel technology and, hence,
to increase labour productivity. We must certainly continue working
to improve economic management, to de-bureaucratise our economy,
and to create more attractive conditions for doing business
and for helping entrepreneurs achieve the goals that are facing
them and the national economy as a whole. We will be working hard,
with a focus on these targets.</p><p>Thank you for your question: it allowed me
to use the materials at hand.</p><p><b>Yelena Glushakova</b>: Thank you. Yelena
Glushakova, RIA Novosti.</p><p>Good afternoon! Mr President, you said we are past the peak
of the crisis, however the economic situation continues
to be very disturbing, something economists say. In particular, your
team mate Alexei Kudrin calls for reforms, but he is known to be
an optimist.</p><p>This week, for example, your Ombudsman, Commissioner
for Entrepreneurs’ Rights, Boris Titov, expressed very disturbing
thoughts. He said, in particular, that the Central Bank interest rate is extremely high.
So our entrepreneurs, who for obvious reasons are unable to borrow
in the West, cannot borrow in Russia either because
the costs are too high. He said that if this situation continues, we will turn into
Venezuela, where there is one national currency exchange rate
on the black market and a very different official rate.</p><p>Do you share these concerns? Do you support
the monetary policy of the Bank of Russia? Do you consider
it necessary to lower interest rates?</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Please give a long
applause for this question.</p><p>Naturally, these are everyone’s concerns.
And of course, everyone wants the Central Bank refinancing rate lowered,
because everyone knows it guides commercial banks in lending
to businesses. This, by the way, is not the only thing that
affects the rates in the commercial sector, but a major one
of course.</p><p>Boris Titov does the right thing in fighting
for the interests of the business community, and it is important that we
have such a man and such institutions. Why do you think
I insisted on appointing a business ombudsman
in the first place? Because I want to hear different points
of view, and I do not want to miss important
and essential elements of our economic life over all the current
issues.</p><p>To begin with, I will simply answer your question. I support
the policy that the Central Bank and the Government pursue
to ensure macroeconomic stability. That is first.</p><p>Second, however much we want to lower
the rate, it cannot be done by administrative methods. We have
to work from the realities of our economy and its
structure. Of course, I often hear this talk about interest rates
being far lower outside Russia. Of course, there are lower rates. So they
do it on purpose. But they have other problems, and a different
economic structure. We are
threatened by inflation, and they probably have deflation looming
when manufacturers cannot sell what they make. That is their problem.</p><blockquote><p>I support
the policy that the Central Bank and the Government pursue
to ensure macroeconomic stability.</p></blockquote><p> We have a different problem. To lower
the rate, we
need to help the Central Bank and the Government suppress
inflation and reduce devaluation risks and expectations, rather than
snap at the regulator as was common in Soviet times
in the planned economy. Once we can do both, once we start down this
road, then the market will calm down naturally and Central Bank refinancing rate will decrease.</p><p>When there’s a possibility to support the real economy, the Central Bank
is doing it anyway. That said, it should not be pushed to do even more, since
this could affect its ability to keep the inflation at bay, which is one of the key issues, not the only, but still a very important one. It could prompt the question: Does the Central Bank have any objectives other than making sure that
the country’s financial and banking systems are up and running? And we can
argue that this is the way things are at the present time. What else is the Central Bank doing? For example, together with the Government it is working on the so-called project financing programmes: the Government oversees a wide
range of projects under various programmes worth tens of billions of dollars,
about 250 billion already, and up to 500 billion moving forward. Under these
programmes, the Central Bank provides funding to Russian private banks so that
they can finance these specific programmes. The Central Bank is also involved
in new investment projects. It uses a wide range of instruments. For now, this
is enough.</p><p><b>Veronika Romanenkova</b>: TASS news agency, Veronika
Romanenkova.</p><p>Mr Putin, could you tell us in all honesty whether you are satisfied
with the Government’s work? To what extent are the initiatives that are being
taken against the backdrop of crisis developments you’ve just described
adequate? Can any changes in the Government line-up be expected?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Well, as you may know or could have
noticed throughout the years I’ve been in office, I a) value people highly and b) believe that
staff reshuffles, usually, but not always, are to be avoided and can be
detrimental. If someone is unable to work something out, I think that I bear
part of the blame and responsibility. For this reason, there will be no
changes, at least no major reshuffles.</p><p>We are working together with the Government on ways to improve its
structure. This is true. This is about finding solutions for enhancing the Government’s efficiency with respect to the most sensible economic and social
issues. There are plans to this effect, but there’s nothing dramatic about them
and they don’t boil down to specific individuals. Our efforts are aimed at improving the operations of this crucial governing body.</p><p> As for the question whether
I’m satisfied or not, overall I think that the Government’s work has been
satisfactory. Of course, it can and should be even better. An anti-crisis plan
was drafted and enacted in early 2014. I don’t remember its exact title, but
essentially this was an anti-crisis plan. If you look at what has been done,
you can see that unfortunately 35 percent or more than one third of the initiatives
listed in this plan have yet to be implemented. This goes to show that efforts on the administrative, organisational front undertaken by various ministries and agencies did not suffice to respond to the challenges we are facing in a prompt
and timely manner. However, let me reiterate that overall in terms of its
strategy the Government is moving in the right direction and is efficient.</p><blockquote><p>I think

give the floor to Tatars. There
is such a big poster. How can we possibly do without Tatars? Nothing is
possible without Tatars here. </p><p><b>Yelena
Kolebakina: </b>Thank you very much, Mr President. I am Yelena Kolebakina with
Tatarstan’s business newspaper Business Online. The people of Tatarstan will not forgive me if I do not ask you these
questions. </p><p>In your address, you said – you stressed, actually – that the kind, hard-working
people of Turkey and the ruling elite should not be put on the same plane and that we have a lot of reliable friends in Turkey. As you know, over the years
Tatarstan has forged extensive economic and cultural ties with Turkey. What are
we supposed to do now? Rupture these ties, cut our bonds with the entire Turkic
world? After all, this is precisely the message of Vladimir Medinsky’s recent telegram with his
recommendation that all contacts with the international organisation of Turkic Culture (TURKSOY) be broken. What is to be done with the Turkish investors who have invested a quarter of all foreign direct investment
in Tatarstan? This is my first question. </p><p>And allow me to ask the second question or the people of Tatarstan will be unhappy.
In keeping with the federal law, from January 1, 2016, President Rustam
Minnikhanov of Tatarstan will no longer be referred to as president. However,
this can hurt the ethnic feelings of all Tatars in the world while you – let me
remind you – have always said that in accordance with the Constitution, it is up to the republic itself to decide what to call the head of the region. So, will the federal centre insist on renaming the position of the head of Tatarstan after
all? </p><p>Thank
you. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Yes, I saw the “Turkey” poster. Please go ahead with your question and you too. We will sort this out.</p><p><b>Yelena Teslova: </b>Yelena Teslova
with the Anadolu news agency. I have a similar question. I would also like to start
off with the fact that in your Address to the Federal Assembly, you said that
we should not put the Turkish people and the part of the Turkish elite that is
directly responsible for the death of our military personnel in Syria on the same plane. On a day-to-day level, however, the impression is somewhat
different. Complaints are coming to the Turkish embassy in Moscow from students
saying they have been expelled and from business people who say they are about to be
deported. What is to be done about this? </p><p>The second question concerns Syria. The position on the fate of the Syrian president is well-known. Russia says it should be
decided by the Syrian people while the United States and its allies insist that
he has no political future. Did you address the issue with John Kerry during
his visit to Moscow? Will this issue be raised in New York? Thank you. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: And your
question please. </p><p><b>Fuad Safarov: </b>Mr President,
Fuad Safarov with the Turkish news agency Cihan. </p><p>The rapid deterioration of relations between Russia
and Turkey benefits neither side. What is more, this has only harmed both sides. Do you
believe there is a third party in this scenario? </p><p> The second question, if you allow me. An Islamic
anti-ISIS coalition was established recently, but we know that there is also
the NATO-led coalition and the Russian-Syrian coalition. It turns out that
there are three coalitions against ISIS. Is it really so difficult to deal with
this evil? Maybe there are some other goals and some other plans here? Maybe it
is not ISIS that is
the problem?

Now, regarding the conflict that has flared up. We believe that the actions of the Turkish authorities (in relation to our warplane, which they
shot down) are not an unfriendly, but a hostile act. They shot down
a warplane and our people were killed. </p><p>What outraged us so much? If it was an accident, as we
heard later, apparently, the Turkish authorities did not even know it was a Russian plane… What is usually done in such cases? After all, people were
killed. They immediately make a phone call and straighten things out. Instead,
they immediately ran to Brussels, shouting: “Help, we have been hurt.” Who is hurting you? Did we
touch anybody there? No. They started covering themselves with NATO. Does NATO
need this? As it turned out, apparently it does not. </p><p>What is the most important thing for us? I want you to understand this. I want our people to hear this and I want Turkey to hear this
as well. Apart from the tragedy, the fact that our people were killed, what has
upset us so much, do you know? You know, we did not refuse to cooperate. When I was last in Antalya I had contact with Turkey’s entire leadership. Our Turkish colleagues raised very
sensitive issues and asked for support. Even though our relations have soured
now (I will not say
what the issue was – this is not my style), but believe me, they raised issues
with us that are very sensitive and that do not fit into the context of international law when we consider the decisions proposed by the Turkish side.</p><p>You will be
surprised, but we said, “Yes, we understand, and we are willing to help.” You
see, I had not heard about the Turkomans (Syrian Turks) before. I knew that
Turkmen – our Turkmen – lived in Turkmenistan, and so I was confused… Nobody
told us about them. But after we indicated our willingness to cooperate on the issues that are sensitive to Turkey, why did not they phone us via the cooperation channels between our militaries to say that during our discussions
we overlooked a certain part of the border where Turkey has vested interests.
They could have expressed their concerns or asked us not to hit certain areas.
But nobody said anything.</p><p>As I said, we were willing to cooperate with Turkey on very sensitive issues. So why did they do it? Tell me,
why? What have they accomplished? Did they think we would just pack up and go?
They could not have thought that of course, Russia is not that kind of country.
We have increased our presence and increased the number of warplanes [in Syria]. We did not have air defence systems there, but after that we dispatched
S-400 systems to the area. We are also adjusting the Syrian air defence system
and have serviced the highly effective Buk systems that we had sent them
before. Turkish planes used to fly there all the time, violating Syrian air
space. Let them try it now. Why did they do it?</p><p>You asked if there is a third
party involved. I see what you mean. We do not know, but if someone in Turkish
leadership has decided to brown nose the Americans, I am not sure if they
did the right thing. First, I do not know if the US needed this. I can imagine
that certain agreements were reached at some level that they would down a Russian plane, while the US closes its eyes to Turkish troops entering Iraq,
and occupying it. I do not know if there was such an exchange. We do not know.
But whatever happened, they have put everyone in a bind. In my opinion – I have
looked at the situation and everything that has happened and is happening there – it appears that ISIS is losing priority. I will share my impressions with
you.</p><p>Some time ago, they invaded Iraq and destroyed
that country (for good or bad is beside
the point). The void set in. Then, elements tied to the oil trading emerged.
This situation has been building up over the years. It is a business, a huge trafficking operation
run on an industrial
scale. Of course, they needed a military force to protect smuggling operations
and illegal exports. It is great to be able to cite the Islamic factor and slogans to that effect in order to attract cannon fodder. Instead, the recruits
are being manipulated in a game based on economic interests. They started
urging people to join this movement. I think that is how ISIS came about. Next, they needed to protect delivery routes. We began attacking their convoys. Now, we can see that
they are splitting up with five,
six, ten, fifteen trucks hitting the roads after dark. However, another
flow, the bulk of the truck fleet, is headed for Iraq, and across Iraq through
Iraqi Kurdistan. In one place there – I will ask the Defence Ministry to show
this picture – we spotted 11,000 oil trucks. Just think of it – 11,000 oil
trucks in one place. Unbelievable.</p><p>Whether there is a third party involved is anyone’s
guess, but a scenario whereby these moves were never agreed with anyone is
quite likely. However, today, the Turkish authorities are taking quite a lot of heat – not directly, though – for islamising their country. I am not saying if
it is bad or good,
but I admit that the current Turkish leaders have decided to let the Americans
and Europeans know – yes, we are islamising our country, but we are modern and civilised Islamists. Remember, what President Reagan said about Somoza in his
time: “Somoza may be a son of a bitch, but he is our son of a bitch.”
Just keep it in mind, we are Islamists, but we are on your side, we are your
Islamists.</p><p>There may be such an overtone, but nothing good
came out of what happened. The goals, even if Turkey had any, not only were not
achieved, but, on the contrary, only exacerbated the situation.</p><p>Now, regarding Turkic peoples residing in Russia. Of course we should maintain contacts with those who are close to us
ethnically. I am saying “us,” because Turkic-speaking peoples of Russia are
part of Russia, and in this sense the Turkish people, whom I mentioned in my Address as a friendly people, and other Turkic-speaking peoples remain our
partners and friends. Of course, we will and must maintain contacts with them.</p><p>We have learned from experience that it is hard or almost impossible to reach common ground with the current Turkish leadership. Even when we tell them
“yes, we agree,” they are trying to outflank or stab us in the back for absolutely no good reason. </p><p>Consequently, I do not
see any prospects for improving relations with the Turkish leaders in terms of state-to-state relations, while remaining completely open to humanitarian
cooperation. However, even this area is not without issues. I think that
Turkish leaders have actually gone beyond their own expectations. Russia is
forced to impose restrictive economic and other measures, for example, in tourism. </p><p>You know, the creeping islamisation that would have made Ataturk turn
over in his own grave, affects Russia. We know that there are fighters from the North Caucasus on Turkish soil. We have told our partners time and again: “We
do not do such
things with respect to Turkey.” But these fighters are still there, they
receive treatment and protection. They benefit from visa-free travel
arrangements and are able to enter Russian territory using Turkish passports
and disappear, while we have to go after them in the Caucasus or in our million
plus cities. For this reason, we will certainly have to do it along with a number of other initiatives to ensure our national security.</p><p>As for the President of Tatarstan, there is a saying in Russia: “Call me a pot but heat me
not.” This is Tatarstan’s business. I do not think that this is such a sensitive issue or that it could hurt national feelings. You know the people in the Caucasus
always react vehemently to all issues related to their national identity.
However, even Chechnya said: no, the country should have only one President,
and we will not call the head of the Republic this way. This was the choice of the Chechen people. We will respect the choice of the people of Tatarstan. It
is up to you to decide, all right?</p><p><b>Anton Vernitsky</b>:
Anton Vernitsky, Channel One.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: I am sorry, I forgot, but I wrote down your question. Again, I am sorry, Anton.</p><p>The fate of the Syrian president. I have said it many times, and I would
like to repeat it: We will never agree with the idea of a third party, whoever
it is, imposing its opinion about who governs who. This is beyond any common
sense and international law. Of course, we discussed it with US Secretary of State Kerry. Our opinion remains the same, and this is our principled approach.
We believe that only Syrians can choose their leaders, establish their government
standards and rules.</p><p>Therefore, I will say something very important now. We
support the initiative of the United States, including with respect to the UN
Security Council draft resolution on Syria. The Secretary of State’s visit
mainly focused on this resolution. We generally agree with it. I think Syrian
officials will agree with the draft, too. There may be something that somebody
does not like. But in an attempt to resolve this bloody conflict of many years,
there is always room for compromise on either side. We believe it is a generally acceptable proposal, although there could be improvements.</p><p>As I have said before, this is an initiative of the United States and President Obama. This means that both the US and Europe are
highly concerned with the current situation in the Middle East, Yemen, Syria
and Iraq. We will do what we can to help settle the crisis and will aim to satisfy all parties with our solutions, however complicated the situation.</p><p>But first, it is necessary to work together on a constitution
and a procedure to oversee possible future elections. It must be a transparent
procedure that everyone trusts. Based on these democratic procedures, Syria
will decide which form of government is the most suitable and who will lead the country.</p><p><b>Anton Vernitsky:</b> Back to the Syria
issue. Mr Putin, do we have a clear-cut plan on Syria or we are acting
impulsively? I mean, Turkey shot down our plane and we immediately increased
our military presence in Syria. When will our military operation end? What will
you regard as the end point of our military operation in Syrian airspace? </p><p>Do you believe that the intra-Syrian conflict can, after
all, be switched to a political track? Though you already talked about it, is
it possible? </p><p><b>Vladimir</b><b>Putin</b><b>: </b>I was trying to answer this just now. We think that, A, it is
possible; and, B, we believe that there is no other way to resolve the situation. This will have to be done in any case sooner or later, and better sooner than later
because there will be fewer casualties and losses, and there will be fewer threats, including
to Europe and to the United States as well. Look, 14 people were killed in the United States − ISIS has made its way into the US. US law enforcement has
acknowledged that it was a terrorist attack committed by ISIS, so it is a threat to everyone. And the sooner we do it, resolve this, the better. </p><p>Let me repeat, there is no solution to this
problem except a political one. Do we have a plan? Yes, we do, and I just spelled it out. In its key aspects, strange as it may sound, it
coincides with the American vision, proposed by the United States: cooperative
work on the constitution, creating mechanisms to control future early
elections, holding the elections and recognising the results based on this
political process. </p><p>Of course, it is a complicated objective and of course there are various mutual
grievances: some do not like this group and others do not like that
group, some want to work with the Syrian Government and others refuse do so categorically. But
what is necessary is that all conflicting parties make an effort to meet each
other halfway. </p><p><b>Anton Vernitsky:</b> And the military
operation?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> What about the military
operation? We said a long
time ago that we will carry out air strikes to provide support for offensive operations by the Syrian army. And that is what we have been doing
while the Syrian army conducts their operations.</p><p>By the way, I have recently said publicly – the idea was proposed by Francois Hollande – that we should try to pool the forces of the Syrian army and at least part of the armed opposition in the fight against ISIS. We have succeeded in working
towards this goal, even if partly.</p><p>At the least, we have found common ground with these people. This part of the Syrian
opposition, these irreconcilable and armed people want to fight against ISIS and are actually doing so. We are supporting their fight against ISIS by delivering
air strikes, just as we are doing to support the Syrian army. When we see that
the process of rapprochement has begun and the Syrian army and Syrian
authorities believe that the time has come to stop shooting and to start
talking, this is when we will stop being more Syrian than Syrians themselves.
We do not need to act in their place. And the sooner this happens, the better for everyone.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b> Mr Brilyov, do
you have anything to add?</p><p><b>Sergei Brilyov:</b> Thank you. Yes,
I want to add to what my Turkish colleagues and Anton [Vernitsky] have said.</p><p>Mr President, first I would like to ask if the Turkish ship has sailed. Can President Erdogan do anything to reverse the situation? And second, we do not
have to be more Syrian than Syrians themselves, but since Turkey’s actions have
forced Russia to increase its contingent at Latakia, maybe we should keep that
base to ensure stability in Syria and the rest of the Eastern Mediterranean?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I do not want to answer for other people and the leaders of other countries. If they believe it possible
and necessary to do something, let them do so. We do not see any change so far. So why should I speak about it now? That is my answer to the first question.</p><p>As for the second question, about the base, opinions differ, you know. Some people in Europe and the US repeatedly
said that our interests would be respected, and that our [military] base can
remain there if we want it to. But I do not know if we need a base there. A military base
implies considerable infrastructure and investment.</p><p>After all, what we have there today
is our planes and temporary modules, which serve as a cafeteria and dormitories. We can pack up in a matter of two days, get everything aboard
Antei transport planes and go home. Maintaining a base is different.</p><p>Some believe, including in Russia,
that we must have a base there. I am not so sure. Why? My European colleagues told me that I am probably nurturing
such ideas. I asked why, and they said: so that you can control things there.
Why would we want to control things there? This is a major question.</p><p>We showed that we in fact did not have
any medium-range missiles. We destroyed them all, because all we had were ground-based
medium-range missiles. The Americans have destroyed their Pershing ground-based
medium-range missiles as well. However, they have kept their sea- and aircraft-based Tomahawks. We did not have such missiles, but now we do – a 1,500-kilometre-range
Kalibr sea-based missile and aircraft-carried Kh-101 missile with a 4,500-kilometre range.</p><p>So why would we need a base there?
Should we need to reach somebody, we can do so without a base.</p><p> It might make sense, I am not sure. We still need to give it some
thought. Perhaps we might need some kind of temporary site, but taking root
there and getting ourselves heavily involved does not make sense, I believe. We will give it some
thought.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>: Colleagues, let's be respectful of each other
and ask one question at a time, OK? So that everyone can get the chance to ask a question. Terekhov,
Interfax, please go ahead.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Sorry, here’s Ukraine, our sister republic.
I’m never tired of saying it over and over again. Please go ahead.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>: Microphone to the first row, please.</p><p><b>RomanTsimbalyuk</b>: Thank you for the opportunity to ask a question, even though we are not Turks, but
Ukrainians.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: I can see that, yes.</p><p><b>Roman Tsimbalyuk</b>: Mr Putin, as a follow-up to your allegations
that there are no Russian servicemen in Donbass, Captain Yerofeyev and Sergeant
Alexandrov, Third Brigade, the city of Togliatti, send their regards to you.</p><p>Are you going
to exchange them for Sentsov, Savchenko, Afanasyev, Kolchenko, and Klykh? And the list goes on.</p><p>One more
question, if I may, just to continue my first question: The Minsk Agreements
are coming to an end, and none of the parties have complied with their provisions.
So, what should we expect from you come January 1? Are you going to launch an offensive again, come up with some negotiation ideas, or maybe forget about
Ukraine for a while? Thank
you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Regarding exchanges.
We’ve never said there are no people there who deal with certain matters,
including in the military area, but this does not mean that regular Russian
troops are present there. Feel the difference. This is the first point. </p><p>Second, you mentioned two or three people you propose exchanging
and then offered a long list of persons to exchange them for. First of all, the exchange should be equitable. Second, we should discuss everything calmly with
our colleagues, talk and propose what we have always insisted on and what the Ukrainian President has proposed. People who are being held on one side and those held on the other should be released. This applies above all to people
from Donbass, southeastern Ukraine, and Ukrainian servicemen who were detained
in these territories. However, the exchange should proceed on an equitable
basis. </p><p>What am I talking about? It’s no secret that the Ukrainian authorities regard all those detained and held in Donbass as people
who are subject to exchange while those who are held in Kiev prisons are considered
criminals and therefore outside the scope of this exchange. People in Donbass
don’t agree with this. This should be treated fairly and it should be said:
Let’s exchange all for all, as President Poroshenko proposed, not selectively –
we’ll exchange these but not those. This is the line to take here and we
support it. We have a lot of disagreements with the Ukrainian authorities but
here we have a common position. </p><p>Now regarding January 1. On January 1, regrettably for us, we predict a deterioration in our economic relations because we had to make
the decision that from January 1, we will no longer treat Ukraine as a member
of the CIS free trade zone. </p><p>EU leaders have proposed and asked me not to expel
Ukraine from the free trade zone and not to strip it of preferences in trade
with Russia in the hope that we will negotiate in a tripartite format –
Russia-EU-Ukraine – for a year and make certain changes in various formats, so that if the EU association
agreement itself is not changed, we will introduce certain amendments through
additional protocols to address our concerns and guarantee our economic
interests. In the period before July, we had asked a hundred times for a tripartite meeting. Contact was only established in July,
you see? The result was practically zero.</p><p>Only recently, I met with the German Chancellor and President of the European Commission in Paris. We received a document. I will use this chance of speaking to such a sizeable audience and explain the specifics shortly. We’ve tried to maintain good economic relations with Ukraine, since
Ukraine is member of the free trade area which offers mutual preferences and zero rates. In its economic relations with Russia and the CIS, Ukraine has used
standards, technical regulations and customs rules which we inherited from the past and which we are gradually changing together. Ukraine is unilaterally
withdrawing from this system and joining the European standards. Those, for example, state that all the goods in the Ukrainian market must comply with EU
technical standards and regulations. But see, our products don’t comply with
them yet.</p><p>Does this mean Ukraine has to keep our goods from its
market? Okay, they heard us. Now Ukraine is officially allowed to keep both
compliant and non-compliant products in their market. It’s not an obligation
but a right. Whether it uses it or not, we don’t know. They have the right to establish a subcommission to decide, but again, it is not an obligation.
However, Russia is expressly required to maintain all preferences in place. No,
it doesn’t work that way.</p><p>Moreover, one doesn’t have to be an expert to see that
Russia is required to bring CIS customs regulations into compliance with EU
standards.</p><p>In Paris, I told them: this doesn’t make any sense.
The three of us (Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan) have argued for years about
these customs duties. And you want us to change the CIS customs regulations
just because Ukraine entered into this agreement with the EU. This is not a fair requirement. It will take years to accomplish.</p><p>Also, it was stated that we must
comply with EU phytosanitary
requirements. Ukraine is willing to do so but nobody discussed it with us. It
is expressly written that Russia has agreed to comply. Since when? We may be in favour of the idea but it will take time. How can you not understand that it
takes time and money? Tens, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars. We need time
too.</p><p>By the way, they told me in Paris, “But
our standards are better and maybe you had better switch to those standards.”
Well, it is true, and we want to, but we need money – we need investments. And we still have our access to external financing blocked. You understand that it
is impossible, I said, so why did you write all this? They said, “But we have
not read this yet.” Look, you have not even read it, but you sent us this
official paper. Should we agree with it?</p><p>Now, about what we will do. We are
not going to impose any sanctions on Ukraine – I want this to be heard. We are
just switching to a most-favoured-nation treatment in trade. Which means conditions
for Ukraine will not be any worse than those for our other foreign partners.
But of course, Russia will grant no more privileges or preferences to Ukraine
from January 1, 2016.</p><p>What will this mean in practice? In practice, it means that the zero tariffs in trade between Russia and Ukraine
will change to the weighted average tariff of 6 percent. Various rates will
range from 3 to 8 or 10 percent. But this is not our choice. We have fought for this not to happen. But they did not want to listen to us. They did so
unilaterally and in the style I just described to you. But we have to work in the conditions we have.</p><p>Now, about launching offensives. I tell
you frankly that we are not interested in exacerbating the conflict. On the contrary, we are interested in resolving this conflict as soon as possible, but
not by way of physical annihilation of people in southeastern Ukraine. By the way, take a look at the results of the municipal elections and see the voting
pattern in the area. In nearly all the regions – nine or ten, I think – the opposition bloc came first or second. </p><p>Even in those territories of Donbass and the Lugansk Region that are controlled by the Ukrainian authorities more than 43
percent voted for the opposition. Don’t the Kiev authorities see this? Are they
so reluctant to take into account the sentiments and expectations of their own
people? We very much hope that we will have an open, honest dialogue. </p><p>Now about the Minsk Agreements. We have heard it a hundred times that Russia must comply with the Minsk Agreements. And this is
what we want! Let’s look at their provisions. First – to introduce amendments
to the Constitution and coordinate them with Donbass on a permanent basis. Has
this been done? Transitional provisions were amended, it seems. And what are
those amendments? The law on the special status was incorporated into the transitional provisions. “On a permanent basis?” I ask all my colleagues. They
all say, “Yes, permanent.” I say, “Do you know that this law has only been
adopted for three years? A year has already passed.” They all say, “Really?” I say, “Yes.” “Is that true, Mr Poroshenko?” He answers, “Yes.” This is almost a direct quote. Everybody says, “You know, he should do it on a permanent basis.”
I say, “He should, nobody is stopping him.”</p><p>Now the law on the special
status. Has the Rada
passed this law? Yes, it
has. Under the Minsk Agreements, it should be “implemented within 30
days by having the Rada adopt a resolution to this effect.” Have they adopted
the resolution? Yes. But how? They added an article, I think number 10, to the law, which stipulates that it can only be implemented after elections, which
means more delays. I told them, “Listen, it says here that the law must be
implemented.” “No, it does not. It says: the Rada must pass a resolution. We
have done it. That is it.” But this is a manipulation.</p><p>If we really want to resolve the problem, let’s stop this, let’s work together. And we are willing to influence
people in the southeast of the country and persuade them to accept a compromise. We are willing and we want it to happen, but we need our partners
in Kiev to be willing as well.</p><p><b>Vyacheslav
Terekhov: </b>Hello, Mr
President. You just talked about a significant expansion of the military
presence in the conflict zone in Syria.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: There you go again about Syria. Ask me about the national economy.</p><p><b>Vyacheslav
Terekhov: </b>No, about Russia, not Syria. </p><p>Sanctions are in force, oil prices are
falling and there are not only sanctions but also a crisis. Will Russia have
enough resources for all this? </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: For what? </p><p><b>Vyacheslav
Terekhov</b>: For military operations, the expansion of its
military presence, for survival. In addition to this, there are more than
enough other problems to deal with. Meanwhile, resources – this is not only
money and military officers. A popular expression has just come to my mind:
“It’s easy to start a war but difficult to end one.” </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: We did not start a war. We are conducting limited
operations with the use of our Aerospace Forces, air-defence systems and reconnaissance systems. This does not involve any serious strain, including
strain on the budget. Some of the resources that we earmarked for military
training and exercises – we simply retargeted them to the operations of our Aerospace Forces in Syria. Something needs to be thrown in, but this does not have any significant
impact on the budget. </p><p>You see, we hold large-scale exercises.
Take the Centre or Vostok-2015 drills alone. Thousands of people are involved.
Thousands are redeployed from one theatre to another. There are hundreds of aircraft and so on and so forth. We simply direct a part of the resources to the operation in Syria. It is difficult to think of a better training exercise.
So, in principle, we can keep training for quite a long time there without
unduly denting our budget. </p><p>As for other components, yes, that is an issue – I mean the economic problems we are faced with. We know what needs to be done and we know how to do it, and we talk about this publicly. </p><p>What can be said in this regard? If we
go back to the economy, of course, here we need to implement import replacement programmes (I believe I mentioned this earlier). Not just import replacement as such, but we need to modernise our economy, enhance labour productivity, improve the business
climate and ensure effective public demand. This is an element of our economic
drive. </p><p> We need to carry out an array
of measures that the Government has publicly announced. And this is what we
will do.</p><p><b>Anastasia
Zhukova:</b> Hello, I am Anastasia Zhukova from
Tulskiye Novosti. Here’s my question. A tragedy occurred in Tula last year when
two babies were burned in a local maternity home. One of them was seriously
injured and suffered burns to almost 80 percent of his body. The issue of his adoption is being reviewed now.
People from all over the country are worried about Matvei’s fate. They worry that he
will be institutionalised. They think the boy will end up in a nursing home.
Most Russians and foreigners want him to be adopted by a loving family.</p><p>Mr Putin, can you please see to his fate
and personally control his adoption and treatment? And what do you think can be
done to prevent such accidents from happening again? Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> This is a horrendous, terrible story. It is impossible to think about it or talk about it without tears.
What a horrible tragedy. I simply do not want to say any more about it now – it is just awful.</p><p>The problem is not rooted in healthcare.
No matter how much money is allotted to it, there will always be people who
will be criminally negligent in fulfilling their duties. This needs to be
monitored. The attitude of personnel to their duties should rest on a completely different approach. </p><p>As for a nursing home or adoption, I know that the entire country is watching the developments. I know this anyway,
and we are keeping an eye on it. Moreover, several people (not one, two or three), several families not only want to adopt Matvei but are fighting for him. I wish them success and want to thank them for this. I hope this issue
will be resolved very soon.</p><p>Young lady, I promised you – go ahead
please.</p><p><b>Yekaterina
Vinokurova:</b> Thank you
for keeping your promises, Mr Putin. Yekaterina
Vinokurova, Znak.com.</p><p>It is December 2015. You have been at the helm for 15 years, and so we can say that a certain system of authority has evolved. I have a question about a very dangerous aspect of this system because we can see
especially clearly now that a very dangerous second generation of the elite has
grown up over this period. One of them is Rotenberg Jr, who has received the country’s long-haul truckers as a present. Another is Turchak Jr, who cannot be
summoned for questioning over the assault of Oleg Kashin, even though
journalists continue to be beaten up in his region. These are also the children
of Chaika, who have a very murky business, which should be investigated. Sorry,
but I do not give a damn whether this is a paid-for reporting or not, because even rumours must be
investigated. There are many more such children who are unable to revive or even preserve Russia, because they are not the elite but only a poor semblance
of it.</p><p>At the same time, when journalists
investigate something or public accusations are made as in the case of Prosecutor General Chaika and his team, the authorities, instead of launching
an investigation, shout that the rumour is being spread by the hateful State
Department or Obama, or order an inspection – for instance, how the prosecutor’s office dealt with the Dozhd TV Channel, which helped investigate
the problem. When the long-haul trackers hold protests, they are accused of acting on somebody’s orders, whereas instead you simply need to talk to them.</p><p>Mr Putin, I have a simple question. Did
you expect to see these results when you assumed power in 2000? Maybe the situation needs improving before it is too late? Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Let’s
start with results. If we want to be objective, we will have to admit that
these are not the only results. Our best achievements are higher incomes for the people and a stronger economy, which has grown by nearly 100 percent. Our
GDP has almost doubled. These are our results. Stronger defences and improved
capabilities of our Armed Forces – these are the results. The fight against
terrorism, which we have not
defeated yet but we have
definitely broken its back – these are the results.</p><p>As for the problems of secondary
importance you mentioned, they can happen anywhere. Now for the reaction of the media and the public to the activities of our high-level officials’ children.
Take young Rotenberg, whom you mentioned: his father does not hold any government
posts, as far as I know. Maybe he has found his way into a government agency
since I last looked, but I do not think so.</p><p>As for Mr Chaika, and who else? Turchak
and the rest. I am
aware of the reports by the media and online that, say Turchak was involved in beating up journalists. Is he the one responsible or is his father involved?
There is a famous
Soviet-era joke, when an HR manager says: We are not going to promote this guy. Why? He had an incident with a fur coat. It turned out that five years ago his wife’s fur coat
was stolen in a theatre. Something had happened, so the guy will not be promoted,
just in case. This should not be our attitude. You are right to raise this
issue. No, I really mean it. This provides us with an opportunity to respond… I mean, it is our obligation to respond.</p><p>Regarding all the issues you have mentioned,
especially those related to the children of high-ranking officials… Let’s take
for example the Prosecutor
General – he heads a very important institution. We have to understand did the Prosecutor General’s
children commit an offence or not?
Does anything point to a conflict of interest in the Prosecutor General’s work? Did he assist or help his children in any manner? For that, we have the Presidential Control
Directorate. I did not
want to mention this issue, but it does not mean that we are not working on it. All the information should
be carefully reviewed. The same goes for examining all the reports online. </p><p> Let’s now move to the truck
drivers. Are there any questions on this particular issue? Are there any
questions about the truck drivers? Go ahead. Maybe someone can articulate this
question better.</p><p><b>Question: </b>My question is
not just about the truck
drivers. Everyone is aware of professional drivers’ problems, why
they have been protesting for weeks against the problems with
the new toll system. But I have questions on behalf of the entire
driving community.</p><p>Ordinary motorists are also forced to pay.
For example, there is
this new road being built from Moscow to St Petersburg, recognised by all
as the most expensive in Europe. For example, a drive
to the nearest Moscow suburb and back costs 1,000 rubles, more
than a small amount for most people.</p><p>In Moscow,
the metered parking policy has reached residential areas where there
actually was not
any serious need for it, as many have said. But drivers have been
told that this is the way things are in Europe. But we have
a standard of living far lower than them, and even you pointed
out at the beginning of this news conference that real income
has declined. So my question is: is it fair to dump these high
charges on all categories of motorists?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Paid parking is
kind of beyond the point; it’s another matter. As for these car parks in Moscow, all major
metropolitan areas at some point have to introduce paid parking
because the problem cannot
be solved in any other way. Of course common sense should prevail
here too and you need to watch not only what to do but how
to do it, and prices should be based on reality. However,
the Moscow city authorities have made this decision. You need to know
this.</p><p>The Moscow
authorities decided that parking prices should not be directly set
by the mayor's office, but only after consultations with
the municipalities and with the districts. Moreover,
the local elected authorities, district authorities have the right to decide
on this issue – they have been given that authority. And parking
is free for people who live in the buildings next to these
car parks. I can assure you that the citizens concerned,
the Muscovites who live near these car parks, are more in favour
of the policy than against it.</p><p>The charges
apply to those who arrive from other districts or other regions: from
the Moscow suburbs and so on. This does not mean, however, that we should not think about
them at all. And of course, the fees should have some
relation to average incomes. But I repeat, these decisions are
largely up to the local municipalities. The revenue from parking goes entirely,
completely, one hundred percent, into the local district budgets. </p><p>I would like
to reiterate that this does not mean the upper levels and limits
should be ignored. After all, this is the prerogative of district
and city authorities, above all, the districts. </p><p>Now, regarding
other components of the auto business. </p><p>Most importantly,
Rotenberg Jr was
mentioned here. What should I say, and what is important? It is
important to get to the bottom of the problem, not try
to use a difficult situation for some quasi-political purposes,
but look inside. And what lies inside? All revenues coming from
the Platon system – all 100 percent – do not go into somebody’s pocket
but into the Road Fund of the Russian Federation, down
to the last cent, and from there all this money, down
to the last cent, is spent on road construction in Russian
regions. I would
like you to hear this. This is the first point. </p><p>Second, where does
this joint venture set up by Rostekhnologii and the company represented
by private investors get funding from? Directly from
the budget – I believe about 10 billion [rubles]. For what
purpose? For the repair and maintenance of this system, keeping
it operational, for development. However, what does it mean that they
receive funding from the budget? This means that everything can be
checked, including by the public and the Accounts Chamber,
which is very important. If some people think that these maintenance
and development costs are inflated, let them do calculations
and submit them. This will be the right thing to do –
calculate and submit. This can be done – [count] the money
and revenues from Platon, the company created by private investors and Rostekhnologii –
these revenues do not
go there. I want this to be heard.</p><p>Where did
the idea come from? It came from the Government. Why? For two
reasons.</p><p>First, because
economic agents across all transport sectors, including aviation, river, sea
and rail transport, pay taxes and infrastructure fees, including
on the railway. Motor vehicle owners pay only a portion
of the infrastructure tax through the excise tax on petrol.
But that is only
a portion of it. In other industries, economic agents pay
infrastructure fees in full. This had a portion of cargo travel
from rivers, seas and railways to motor roads. Huge numbers
of trucks flooded motor roads, causing damage to infrastructure.
A motor vehicle tax is the same for passenger cars
and trucks weighing 12 tonnes or more.</p><p>I know that
those guys are saying there is
no difference between a passenger car and a heavy-duty truck.
But this is not true. Experts say that during acceleration and braking,
12-tonne trucks do more damage to the roadbed than cars. However, they pay the same
amount. This proposal seeks to create a level playing field
for all types of transport.</p><p>Second,
the licensing of this activity was stopped in 2008 or 2007
as part of the war on red tape. It seemed like a good
idea, but what do we have as a result? Large numbers of people
go ahead and buy heavy-duty trucks and get away with it. But this is
an absolutely grey economy. They are not even licensed as sole proprietors.</p><p>I come from
a working-class family, and I know that these guys work hard
driving these trucks, but we need to leave grey schemes behind. I would like
to support them, believe me. Ms Pamfilova came to see me
and said that she met with them, and they are hard workers
and nice people overall. However, we must shed these grey schemes,
and help truck drivers out as well.</p><p>Someone asked me if
I am pleased with
the Government or not. Here certain things must still be fine-tuned. How do we go about
it? How do we get them out of the scheme and make sure that we
do not charge them
too many fees and taxes? There is a simple way to do this. They should be given
an opportunity to purchase inexpensive patents. However, there is a problem.
Patents are issued for a year, while there may be seasonal transport.
Let the Government think about it in advance and do it.</p><p>Some time ago,
the Government reviewed the possibility of introducing
a similar fee. They charge for mileage covered by heavy-duty
trucks in many countries around the world. In Belarus, truck
drivers are paying seven times more than is suggested in Russia. They are
paying seven times more for their mileage, just think about it. We said
that the motor vehicle tax can be cancelled after transiting to this
system. The tax was not
cancelled upon the request of the regional authorities,
as the motor vehicle tax goes straight to the regional
budget. It must be cancelled at least for heavy-duty trucks whose
owners must pay for mileage. I hope the Government will do so
in early 2016.</p><p>I know that
there is concern over having to buy various devices. They also cost money.
Here also it is necessary to take a thorough look into who must pay
and for what. </p><p>For instance,
a tachograph, a device showing how much time a driver has been
at the wheel. Listen, after all, this must be paid for.
And people all over the world pay for this. It must be done
to ensure the safety of both heavy-truck drivers and other
motorists. Because when a person works overtime, sitting
at the wheel for 20 hours on end, he poses a threat
to himself and to other road users. Yes, this must be paid for.
I cannot
recall how much, but this must be paid for. </p><p>And there are
two more devices. One is the Platon tracking device , which must be
provided to all free of charge, and the other is
the ERA-GLONASS system (or the SOS system, so to speak),
which sends out an emergency signal. The latter device must be tucked
away in a safe spot to prevent it from getting damaged during
an accident. And so, the first and second systems
[tachograph and Platon] can be put together in one box, while
the third system must for the time being be hidden deep inside
a vehicle. And by the way, it must also be provided free
of charge. </p><p>Some people say
that while it must be installed on new trucks free of charge, money
is charged for installing it on used trucks. No, they must not charge anything.
Around two million have already been produced, as far as I know.
</p><p>As a matter
of fact, this is the initiative of Rostekhnologii, and not of any private
persons. Why? Because, first, Rostekhnologii proposed a technical solution, assigned
the work to their enterprises and created jobs, so this is their
intellectual product. Why do we need private persons there? We need them
as investors. They have invested 29 billion rubles (by the way,
as regards the elites, they or their children can do something,
or cannot), invested these 29 billion rubles in Russia, and not
in the United States, or Cyprus or anywhere else.
The point is that the system needs to be adjusted, that’s true. </p><p> I hope the Government will make all these
decisions, including taxes on transport vehicles in the near
future – no later than the first quarter.</p><p><b>Tamara Gotsiridze:</b> Tamara
Gotsiridze, Maestro TV. </p><p>Mr President, I have
a general question about the future of Russian-Georgian
relations. Three years have passed since the change of government
in Georgia. There were expectations of a summit. It is still unclear why this
has not been held
yet. People hoped that Russia would ease visa restrictions for Georgians
or make travel visa-free altogether but there is no progress on this
either.</p><p>I have this
question: what does each side need to do? What does Moscow expect from
Tbilisi? What can be expected of Moscow to bring Russian-Georgian
relations to a new level? What do you think about our prospects?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> As for the events
in 2008 and the subsequent decline in our relations, we have talked about this
many times, but I consider myself obliged to repeat it. We are not
to blame for the deterioration in relations.
The former Georgian leaders and the then President Saakashvili
should not have made the adventurist decisions that triggered Georgia’s
territorial disintegration. This is their fault, their historical fault. They
are fully to blame for this.</p><p>Now the export
of politicians has begun. They are actively operating in another
former Soviet republic – independent Ukraine. As you can see, they
have not changed
their approach.</p><p>I have already mentioned
this but I would
like to repeat it. I think this is simply a slap
in the face of the Ukrainian people. Not only have they
been put under an external administration but they have also had to accept so-called
politicians that were delegated there. By the way, I think
Saakashvili was never granted a work visa to the United States
but they sent him to run the show in Ukraine and he is functioning
there. </p><p>What was Ukraine
told? We will not only organise you –
we will send people
who will administer over you, people from more civilised countries –
either your neighbours or from overseas.</p><p>We will put all of them
into key positions: finance, the economy, and so on and so
forth because you do not
know how to do it well. Others know but you do not.</p><p>Is it impossible
to find five or ten honest, decent and efficient managers out
of 45 million people? This is simply a slap in the face
of the Ukrainian people.</p><p>Now let’s turn
to relations with Georgia. We did not initiate the collapse of these
relations bit we are
willing to restore them. As for Georgia’s territorial integrity,
this is primarily up to the people of Georgia, South Ossetia
and Abkhazia. It would be necessary to work with them. We will accept any decision.</p><p>Today, despite
the difficulties you mentioned we notice signals from the current
Georgian leaders and we are receiving them. Imagine, today Russia accounts
for two thirds of Georgia’s wine and wine stock exports. They
are coming to the Russian market not to some other market
abroad. We are importing these products as well as others
and our trade has increased. It declined a little this year due
to general economic difficulties, but on the whole it is demonstrating
fairly high growth rates.</p><p>As for visas,
we think we are ready to cancel
them with Georgia.</p><p><b>Yekaterina
Vyskrebentseva: </b>Yekaterina Vyskrebentseva, TV Centre. </p><p>Mr President, I would like to go
back to Russian economic problems. This autumn, it became obvious that
regional debt has grown significantly. Experts, the Ministry
of Finance, the Accounts
Chamber and foreign analysts are saying that one
of the principal reasons for this is regional budget imbalances.
For example, some regions spend up to 65 percent of the GDP
to meet their social
security obligations…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: GRP [Gross
Regional Product]. </p><p><b>Yekaterina
Vyskrebentseva: </b>Right, I am
sorry. This leaves nothing for economic development, which, as you
just said, is a key objective today. </p><p>What is
the way out of this situation? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Generally
speaking, when all is said and done, it is in fact the primary
objective of the regional authorities to meet their social
security obligations to the public. </p><p>What is economic
development? Economic development can and should be ensured above all
by creating
conditions for such development. We always cite a number
of Russian regions as an example. Say, Tatarstan and Kaluga Region, among
others, they are creating
such conditions. Top regional officials simply give their cellphone number to major
investors and say: “Call me if there is any problem.” They take measures
to provide tax incentives. </p><p>Today federal law provides for such possibilities:
two-year tax holidays for new businesses, priority development areas, and so on.
A region can grant a lot of preferences to encourage businesses
to develop in a particular region. </p><p>Of course,
regional budgets need funds to develop infrastructure for future
investment. Indeed, there are problems related to high debt levels
in certain regions. However, the government is making appropriate
decisions. This year we have provided an additional 160 billion rubles
from the federal budget to regional budgets – 310 billion
in all. For what? For regional debt restructuring. Where
commercial loans were taken out at 11–12 percent interest they can receive
loans from the federal budget at 0.1 percent interest. </p><p>Next year,
the federal budget will
provide another 310 billion rubles for regional debt restructuring.
</p><p>However,
the most important thing is that these regional loans are spent
on addressing primary, not secondary objectives. </p><p>What is
the most important thing in terms of development? This [money]
should be spent on creating new jobs, providing conditions for new
manufacturing facilities, new technology and new infrastructure so that
investment generates revenue that can be used to repay loans
and generate additional funding for regional budgets. Unfortunately, this is something
that we still need to work on.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b> Let’s
continue. A question from OTR, the Public Television of Russia.</p><p><b>Tamara Shornikova:</b> Thank you.
Tamara Shornikova, the OTR public television network.</p><p>We asked our
audience in the regions to suggest a question
for the President. The most popular question was, “How can you
survive on a pension or even wages without falling behind
on your housing and utility payments?”</p><p>People
in small towns and villages have to make a very difficult
decision every month: Should they spend their pension or salary on mandatory payments
and then try to live until the next pay day or not?
The trouble is that the authorities claim that the average
salary in their town or village is 20,000, 30,000 or even 40,000
rubles, while the people say many of them receive between 7,000
and 8,000 rubles. The low-income groups receive benefits, but not
everyone is entitled to them, and not all municipal authorities have
the funds to help everyone who really needs this assistance.</p><p>Maybe
the Federal Government should step in at long last? Maybe there
is a mechanism for doing this, and if not, one should be
created, so that rent, electricity, gas and water fees do not exceed a certain
share of people’s income,
which has been decreasing? Meanwhile, the bills keep growing.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I believe
that your question is certainly an issue of priority importance
for millions in our country.</p><p>The OTR
audience is not very large, probably, but I sometimes watch your
programmes. And I want to thank the TV network team. You
make interesting, substantive and solid shows in response
to people’s questions; you ask sharp questions and try to find
answers to them. You have asked me one of such questions. They
concern housing and utility fees, people’s spending on these
payments, and pensioners’ incomes.</p><p>Let’s start with pensioners’ incomes. You
know that the Government has adjusted retirement pensions
for inflation despite last year’s high inflation rate. Pensions were
increased by more than 11 percent, and 10 percent for social
pensions, I think.</p><p>Honestly, this was
almost impossible, but we still managed to do it. Next year, all
categories, including those receiving military pensions, will receive a 4
percent increase. We will
see how the situation in the Russian economy plays out.
I would really like 2016 indexation to be at least on par
with the annual rate of inflation. I cannot say whether we will be able to do
it or not, since we have to respond to the situation
and simply cannot
sacrifice the budget, since it would hurt everyone at the end
of the day.</p><p>Now
for housing and utilities. This year, rates were increased 8.7 percent
on average and are
expected to go up another 4 percent next year. Consequently, we expect
this cost to decrease. However, this will not affect rates
for building maintenance, waste removal, etc. These issues have to be tackled by the municipalities.</p><p>In addition,
under the federal law, families who pay more than 22 percent of their
income for utilities are
entitled to subsidies. The federal law also enables regions
to introduce an even lower threshold to subsidise families who
pay less than 22 percent of their income for utilities. If I am not mistaken, this is
the case in Moscow and many other regions.</p><p>There is no doubt
that this issue deserves the most careful attention; we need to closely monitor the property management companies.
A lot has yet to be done to improve this system. Make no
mistake, this will be a priority for the Government and the regional
authorities. It is
true that we have a long way to go before we settle this issue.</p><p>Now
for the system you have
mentioned, and whether the system that has been proposed will be
adopted or not. What is this system all about? Under federal law, there is
a method for calculating the average possible increase
and the possible variations both ways. This method is expected to be
developed by the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, which will be
in charge of overseeing what the regional authorities are doing
in this area. This is to say that not only will we monitor what
the regions are doing but also how the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service
carries out its functions.</p><p><b>Nathan Hodge</b>: Thank you, Mr President. My name
is Nathan Hodge, Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Now, with
the sharp fall in oil prices and the economic crisis, isn’t
it time to privatise state-owned companies such as Rosneft
and Aeroflot to fill the budget? Will the privatisation
of state-owned companies improve their management and help withstand
the crisis? Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: As we all
know, privatisation of large companies solves two problems. The first
problem is unrelated to fiscal issues or budget profits, although
this is also important. But most importantly it changes the ownership
structure, increasing the efficiency of enterprises.</p><p>As for Rosneft
or Aeroflot, which you mentioned, other companies often recalled
in this context, I wrote in my articles back in 2012
that it was possible, and in principle, we are going to continue
this work.</p><p>We will certainly
always ask ourselves whether the market conditions are right to sell
these valuable assets, which, so to speak, bring positive results
to the economy, the budget, say, Rosneft. It is virtually
impossible to say if the situation or conditions are right,
although as you know, the Government did not take a decision
on privatisation this year.</p><p>Yet, I do not
rule out that the government might go for these decisions
to generate income and make some changes in the structure
of these large companies, to avoid tapping reserves. I try not to interfere
with such decisions, especially as it is not as if
the government will lose its controlling stake in those companies
anyway.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b> We have
a question from a company that recently celebrated
an anniversary, Russia Today.</p><p><b>Ilya Petrenko:</b> Good
afternoon Mr Putin. First, I would
like to thank you again for your greetings on the tenth anniversary
of the RT channel. The English Section appreciated your recent
gift to Sports Minister
Vitaly Mutko, an English phrasebook.</p><p>Does this mean that
not just Mr Mutko but also his other colleagues in the Russian
Government will need this phrasebook in the near future, considering
the worsening relations with our Western partners, including our
English-speaking partners?</p><p>And now
a more serious question: What relations do you expect to have with
the next US president? There will be presidential elections
in the United States next year. Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Regarding
foreign languages, Russia is an open country and English is certainly
the most widely used language in business, culture
and diplomatic relations. English has replaced French
as the lingua franca of diplomats. We encourage the study
of foreign languages at schools and universities. We have
programmes for training young professionals not only in Russia but
also abroad, and we will
continue to do so. I hope that my colleagues
at the Government ministries and agencies and also
in the regions will contribute to these efforts.</p><p>As for Mr
Mutko, you can make fun of him, but he has no problems in this
respect and is willing to work for his own improvement.
Actually, this is very good. I would never have given him this gift if
I did not know
he would take it
in stride and not develop a complex. You can make fun
of him, of course, but you must admit that he knows what he wants
and how to get it. He is working to improve, which is not easy. It is one thing when you start learning
a foreign language as a child, and it is quite another matter
when you do it at a mature age. By the way, learning
a foreign language is very good brainwork. In fact, it is the best form
of ‘brain jogging.’ I hope my colleagues will listen to me
and do this too.</p><p>And your
second question?</p><p><b>Ilya Petrenko:</b> It is about the next US
president.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: The next US
president. First, we need to figure out who it is going to be.</p><p>No matter who he
or she may be, we are prepared and willing to develop our relations
with the United States. I think the recent visit
by the US Secretary of State showed that the United States
is willing to make certain moves towards jointly addressing issues that
can only be resolved together. This is already a sensible position. We
have been supporting it in every possible way and will continue
to do so in the future.</p><p>We are never closed
to this, no matter whom the American people elect as their president.
It is them who are
constantly trying to tell us what we should do in our country, who
should get elected and who should not, and what procedures to follow. We never meddle
in other people’s affairs. They say it is dangerous to do so in America. They
say that if foreign observers get closer than five metres to a line of voters,
they could end up in prison. We are not doing even that, right? We are open
and will work with any president voted in by the American people.</p><p><b>Yevgeny Dzichkovsky</b>: As a follow-up to the question about Mr Mutko. The government is spending big money
on professional sports. Senior citizens will agree with me. There is a parable
that you can feed a hungry man by giving him a fish or a fishing rod. We are
giving our sport a big fish, a sturgeon, to try to promote
the prestige of our country, but then this doping, which they have
regularly caught us red-handed with. What we get instead of boosting our image
is a blow to the country. Who will be held accountable for this? So far,
we have seen two
token resignations and the actual disqualification of our athletic federation. Who
will answer for this, what do you think? Also, please say a few words
about the corruption scandal at FIFA. Should we be looking for Western
ulterior motives in this, or is it simply a hunt for bribe-takers?
Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: There are
underhanded dealings, of course, there is no way to get around it. Most importantly,
as I have
always said, no country should or has any right to extend its
jurisdiction to other states, especially international organisations. This
does not mean that
we should not fight
corruption. Of course, we should. But we believe that seizing foreign
nationals around the world and dragging them to their country
for an investigation and then a court trial is
unacceptable.</p><p>What should we do
in this regard? It is
imperative to maintain an equal, transparent, and open
partnership with all countries. Not to impose your own jurisdiction
on anyone else, but just work with everyone in an honest
and open manner. I hope that someday we will get there. We will go from the efforts to establish
domination to cooperation, including the fight against corruption.</p><p>The investigation
will show whether or not FIFA is involved in corruption. There are no
results from this investigation yet. Someone out there is confessing, while
others refuse to talk.</p><p>As for Joseph
Blatter, he is
a very respected person. He has done a lot for the development
of world football. His contribution to the world’s humanitarian
sphere is enormous because he has always tried to treat football not
as a sport but as an element of cooperation between
countries and peoples. He is the one who should be awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize. </p><p>As for the choice
of this or that country and potential problems – we do not know anything about
them. We know one thing for sure – that we received the right
to host the World Cup in an absolutely honest competition. It is not our problem that
when, say, FIFA officials arrived before the voting, someone
at the top level simply refused to meet with them. </p><p>At that time
I was Prime Minister and I put all other things aside
and met all my FIFA colleagues. We took them on a tour
around the country and showed them where we would have stadiums. They
met with the regional leaders and they explained how important
football is for us although it was not at the world’s best level.</p><p>Nonetheless, we
explained how important it is for the development of mass sports
in Russia. We showed how many people love football in our country
and how we planned to develop it. FIFA listened to us
and made its decision on the World Cup in 2018 based
on these considerations rather than some corruption-driven motives. If you
remember, I did not
even attend the voting procedure. I arrived after it was over so
as not to interfere or exert any pressure. We could not even apply any
pressure there. So let’s wait for the results
of the investigation and see who is to blame for what.
</p><p>As for doping,
I have expressed my attitude to it more than once. We are
against any doping primarily because doping destroys human health. This is
poison for people. This is the first point. </p><p>Secondly, if
an athlete engages in doping he should by all means be punished
for it because this destroys the very principle
of an honest sports competition and interest in sports
vanishes. By the way, I have huge respect for those who
score high results in speed skiing. But why some people who suffer from
certain diseases since childhood are allowed to take some drugs whereas
others who do not suffer
from the same diseases since childhood are prohibited from taking them? If
an athlete has to take medicines for health reasons, he should
take part in Paralympic rather than Olympic sports.</p><p>There are many
problems in sports and they are not so simple. The main point is
the existence of a common approach to the law
in general and in this case in particular: responsibility
should always be personal if it has been proved. The one who is
to blame, whether it is
the coach, the organiser or an athlete has to be held
responsible. People who have nothing to do with violations should not be responsible
for those who make them. This is simply nonsense! This is unfair
and wrong! These are the principles we will fight for.</p><p>That said,
Russia – and I want to say this once again – should
and will be open to the joint struggle against doping.
I will demand that officials of all departments and levels
openly cooperate with the international agencies without concealing
or hiding anything. We have a stake in this and we will follow this path.</p><p><b>Inna Baskova: </b>Kurgan, Regionalnye
Vesti, Rossiya 1 Channel. As a woman, I cannot but pay a compliment
to you, Mr President, for being in such a good shape. Thank
you very much for that, because our boys are looking up to you, it’s
true! The number of young people leading a healthy lifestyle has
markedly grown. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Without doping,
I warn. Without doping.</p><p><b>Inna Baskova:</b> Yes, without
doping. And we would like these boys, youths… To encourage
and engage them in activities in their native territory,
in their region. </p><p>Kurgan Region receives 24 grants annually under
the Beginning Farmer federal programme to support private farming.
But that is not enough, Mr President.
I am conveying the wishes of all our farmers that three times
more is needed. This year, 70 people expressed a desire to start
their own businesses in the agro-industrial sector, but only 20
received those 1.5-million-ruble start-up grants. Is it possible to redistribute
quotas between the regions in a way that would take into account
the peculiarities of Kurgan
Region? Because with 20 quotas it is not possible to stop the outflow
of specialists from agriculture and encourage young locals
to stay.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b>
The development of the agro-industrial sector and private
farming is an extremely important issue. Of course, I know about
discussions between the supporters of various development trends
for the agro-industrial sector. Some say that large-scale production
should be developed first and that only large-scale production, and not
private farmers, can provide the country with quality food products
in the required volumes. But, nevertheless, without any doubt, we
must also support private farming as a form of agriculture.
Farmers make a significant contribution to ensuring food security.
I have repeatedly said this and can confirm that all plans regarding
support for the agro-industrial sector will be implemented
unconditionally, including financial support. </p><p>Here you just
mentioned the 1.5 million, something that can be viewed as a start-up grant
for their business and maybe that is not enough, but there are also other
instruments available in Kurgan as well as in other regions
of the Russian Federation. It is possible to support those who
want to start their own business by means of regulation,
including financial or tax policies. For example the federal law
gives the right to regional governments to decide
on a two-year tax exemption for start-ups.</p><p>We are talking
private entrepreneurs here, sole business owners, but it is up to them
to choose a legal format for their business. I can assure
you, it would be a significant help. But there are other forms
of support – for example, the single agricultural tax can
be appropriately transformed in order to facilitate
the financial and fiscal burden, we can help them create
the sales infrastructure. I am referring to setting up
associations which could help farmers market their produce.</p><p>Finally, there is
a new and substantial support policy, something that was not in place before:
the domestic market has been freed for our producers,
and the growth the national agriculture is now showing – 3,
maybe 3.5 percent by the end of this year – is good
evidence of that. True, it reflects on the customers,
as prices go up, and it is reflected in the macroeconomic indicators by hiking
inflation, contributing to inflation.</p><p>But
in the end, if we are in it long term, as they say, we
expect to win, by which I mean a boost in agricultural
production. Therefore, Kurgan, along with other regions, should look
at the opportunities that the Government and legislature
are creating to support the farmers as much as they can.
Let's see how the situation develops. And if there is a need, it
is possible to allocate additional resources. We do have such resources
for 2016.</p><p>I saw
a “pensions” poster. Pensions are an important issue. Please. </p><p><b>Yulia Izmailova</b>: Yulia Izmailova,
the <i>Molodoi Leninets</i> [Young Leninist] newspaper, the city
of Penza. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: <i>Molodoi
Leninets</i> is asking about pensions? It surely is thinking ahead. All right,
a question from the Leninists. </p><p><b>Yulia Izmailova</b>: The majority
of our readers are senior citizens. We write a lot about pensions. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Senior citizens,
but they are always young Leninists. Good. Please go ahead. </p><p><b>Yulia Izmailova</b>: I would like to hear
your opinion. In February, pension indexing for working pensioners
will be cancelled. Will this move to economise with working pensioners
result in certain personnel problems, or growth in “off
the book” income? </p><p> <b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: Yes, this issue has been repeatedly debated
in the Government. Let me remind you about the Soviet practice.
An opportunity to work and receive a pension
in the Soviet Union was granted only to people working
in the economic sectors that had personnel shortages – say,
junior medical personnel, healthcare specialists and culture workers. All
others had to choose – either work or receive a pension. </p><p>At one time,
amid the collapse of the social system and the economy
as a whole, we made the decision to pay pensions
to everyone. However, there are different ideas about this, including
a return to Soviet practices. The fiscal gain from not paying
pensions to working pensioners is small. But this decision has not been
made. What makes you think it has? Why do you say that working pensioners will
not receive pensions? There is no such decision. </p><p>A decision has
been made not to index [pensions for working pensioners]. However,
here, too, I would
like to draw your attention to this. Take a closer look
at the decision and inform your readers, but I think that
people will hear it now. </p><p>If a person
has decided to continue working, his pension will not be indexed
in 2016 and 2017 but, say, in 2018, he decides to stop
working and rely only on his pension, then he will not receive
compensation for 2016 and 2017 but all the same, when he finally
stops working, the indexation made for other pensioners will be taken
into account for this category of pensioners as well.
And of course, his pension will be indexed the same as other
people’s pensions over this period. These decisions have been made, but
the implications, among other things, for the labour market, are
still under discussion, under careful consideration.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b> Any
additional questions about pensions? Yes, I see, Rossiyskaya Gazeta.</p><p><b>Kira Latukhina:</b> Kira
Latukhina, Rossiyskaya Gazeta.</p><p>I have
a question that is connected with this issue. For the past year,
the Government and the State Duma have discussed increasing
the retirement age, and they eventually decided that
the retirement age should be increased for officials.</p><p>Will this really
save money? And are there any other plans regarding the retirement
age?</p><p>I also have
a question about military pensioners in light of the on-going
debates about cancelling pensions for working pensioners.</p><p>You said that
the issue is only at the debate stage, but military pensioners,
who constitute a large group of working pensioners, are worried.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> First,
as I said, military pensions will be indexed just as all other
pensions. Pensions will be increased by 4 percent early next year.</p><p>As for working
and non-working pensioners, I do not remember this detail, honestly. I will look into it, but
I think the rules should be the same for all pensioners,
whether they are
working or not working.</p><p>You know what
I think about the retirement age; I have been fighting against
increasing it. But there are problems, of course.
As for increasing the retirement age for federal, regional
and municipal officials to 65 years, both for men and for women,
it will be increased gradually, every six months.</p><p>How will this work?
For example, a woman has reached her retirement age, 55 years,
and should retire. Well, under the new system she will be able
to retire at 55 years and six months. In this way, we will gradually increase
the retirement age for all officials. But it is true that the economic effect will
be very small.</p><p>As for increasing
the retirement age for everyone, I still think that
the time is not right for this. But frankly, many people, both
experts and also people on the street keep telling me that
I mean well but that it would eventually hurt the people. Why is
that? Life expectancy is increasing in Russia. Back in 2005
or 2006, it was barely 65 years, while the current figure is 71.2. The number
of working people who contribute to the pension system is
decreasing, while the number of pensioners is increasing.</p><p>If we do not do anything now,
eventually pension system revenues will decrease. This year they have shrunk
because real wages have contracted, and the pension fund is made
of deductions from wages. The pension system is already running
a deficit, and we have to allocate money from the federal
budget to cover the shortage.</p><p>I hope that
this is a one-off issue, not a systemic one. However, with life
expectancy on the rise, the workforce, as I have already said, is set
to shrink compared to the number of non-employed. This
could lead to systemic issues with replenishing the Pension Fund.</p><p>What are
the possible consequences? In fact, this could result in lower
incomes for retirees. The Government will be left with no choice but
to reduce retirement benefits or increase the retirement age.
But if this is the case, it should be done the same way as with
the officials: calmly and without any haste.</p><p>When should it
happen? I cannot
answer this question yet. We will
have to do it at some point. All the countries have already done
it, I mean the neighbouring countries. However, I would prefer
not to publically discuss when it should be done, because we have yet
to answer this question ourselves. In any way, this is
a relevant economic issue for us.</p><p>All other countries
have also opted for a step-by-step approach. There is currently
an age gap between those who just retired and those who retired a long time ago,
and it is set to grow even more. We need to act
in a timely manner so that the pension system does not collapse
in five, 10 or 15 years.</p><p> What I want to say and people
to hear: there is no way it will affect people who have already retired.
They have nothing to do with the changes to the retirement
system, no one will be forced to start working once again, even those who
retired only yesterday. The law is not retroactive, so all those who have
already retired are 100 percent sure to be able to fully benefit from
their retirement rights.</p><p><b>Dmitry
Peskov</b>: RBC, second row. Could you pass the microphone, please?</p><p><b>Mikhail
Rubin</b>: Mr Putin, there are a number of media outlets within RBC
media holding, so if I may and not to offend anyone,
I would like to ask not one but a few brief questions.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: How many is a few?</p><p><b>Mikhail
Rubin</b>: Two.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: There are a lot of people in this audience.</p><p><b>Mikhail
Rubin</b>: The questions will be brief.</p><p>First,
state-owned companies, which our colleague from the Wall Street Journal has already
mentioned, did not cut their employees’ salaries and bonuses during
the crisis, but these very companies are constantly asking
the Government for tax breaks or funds from the National
Welfare Fund. What do you say to these requests?</p><p>I would be
remiss not to ask you about Yekaterina Tikhonova, who is in charge
of an important project at Moscow State University. Our Western
colleagues tell us that she is your daughter. Is it true and what do you
think about her endeavour?</p><p>We have
a big favour to ask from you personally. Our reporter has been
in jail for five months now. He is the person behind
a high-profile investigation of the Vostochny Space Launch Centre
fraud. His name is Alexander Sokolov. He has been charged with a non-violent
offence. If I may, I would like to give you, when possible, our
request to look into this matter. We are concerned that the issue may
involve pressure against the freedom of speech.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: I have read online publications and other sources about
Yekaterina Tikhonova and my other possible relatives
and daughters.</p><p>A short
while ago, everybody was saying that my daughters: a) study abroad;
and b) live permanently abroad. Fortunately, no one is saying this now.
What they are saying now is that they — and that is true — live
in Russia and have never left Russia for permanent residence
in any other country. They studied only at Russian universities. This does
not mean that they do not have contacts with their colleagues. I am proud of them. They continue to study and work.</p><p>Someone
from Russia Today asked me about languages. My daughters are fluent
in three European languages. They also have conversational skills
in one or two Oriental languages, and a fourth European
language. They are not just fluent, they use these languages in their
work. They are making the first steps in their careers, and are
doing well. I do not usually discuss family-related issues. They do not
engage in business or politics, just keep a low profile. </p><p>With
regard to the university project that you mentioned, regardless
of the names of those who are engaged in it, it was
spearheaded by the rector. It is a good initiative. What does it
concern? It concerns combining the capabilities of our higher
educational institutions and research with the needs of our
major enterprises and the national economy. We have one group of people
who run around and do not know how to place their inventions, while the other group is paying tonnes of money, billions of dollars,
to buy Western technology and finished products. This endeavour
initiated by the rector is very useful. It is still too early
to say whether it is a success or not. You should ask
the rector and those who are involved in this work.</p><p>I have
never been specific about my daughters’ workplaces and their line
of work, and I am not going to do so now. For many reasons,
including out of security considerations. I believe that everyone is
entitled to their own destiny. My daughters have never been
star-struck children. They never craved the limelight. They just live
their lives and do so with great integrity.</p><p>About
Sokolov. If he has been imprisoned for some eye-opener piece, including
on the Vostochny Space Launch Centre… I would be grateful
to him for putting effort into this issue. It is just that
I know nothing about this, it is the first time I am hearing
about the whole situation, and his name. But of course I will
look into it. If that is the case, I will certainly try to help
your publication, and that particular journalist.</p><p>But first
I need to understand what has happened to him, I just do not
know. But you have this paper, will you give it to me? I am
interested to have this project, one I actually initiated
at the time, a few years ago, up and… I even visited
the site, to help choose the place for the future space
centre. At first experts suggested other sites, a few places
on the Pacific coast, not far from Vladivostok. They almost broke
ground for it there.</p><p>Then these
same experts said no. If you look at what the Americans are doing
at Cape Canaveral, they said, they often postpone landing or lift-off
due to the weather. The ocean causes a lot
of problems, including an unstable climate, unstable weather, so it
is best that we moved further inland. And we did, moving to where it
is today.</p><p>It is
a major project, of national importance. We are building a whole
new city there, and I hope that everything will be done in time.
There are delays, there were about one and a half years behind, now they
have reduced the backlog to four or five or six months.
I hope that the first launch timeframe we identified –
the first quarter of next year – will be met, but it is not wise
to concentrate on specific dates so much. It is more important
to have everything done well, and I anticipate that it will be.</p><p>Now
the first part of your question – about state companies,
benefits, wages and the use of the National Welfare Fund.
You are absolutely right in saying that everyone – state-owned companies
and state authorities included – having to work more effectively
to reduce inefficient spending. There is certainly room
for improvement here, a lot of work. I totally agree with
you.</p><p>With
regard to salaries, bonuses and so on, I think we talked about
it last year, you know, the problem is that these amounts are calculated
based on what senior executives make. We need the most upscale,
world-class professionals, and not only Russian nationals to work
for these companies, the best managers, and these salaries
and bonuses are legalised on foreign labour markets.</p><p>If we cut
them, we will not get the high quality management we want. Another thing
is that the senior executives (I never told them that, so I hope
they hear me) could use part of their income, which they tell me –
and it is true – they need to ensure that subordinate managers
have theirs paid in full, could give some of their income
to charity, as is also expected by world standards. This would
hardly make them poor.</p><p>Regarding
the National Welfare Fund, yes, they must improve the quality of administration
and performance, and reduce inefficient costs, which I have already
mentioned. I am personally very careful with any potential spending from
the National Welfare Fund. What is the current purpose of this?
The money must be spent on projects that will not lead to more
spending by the fund but create conditions for economic
development.</p><p>What are these
projects? For example, 150 billion rubles was invested
in the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Baikal-Amur Railway.
This is economically advantageous and efficient, because there is already
cargo to carry that will pay off the investment. I think so far,
only 50 billion has been allocated for the Baikal-Amur Railway.
I personally had several meetings with shippers. As soon
as the railway is complete, transport will start
and the National Welfare Fund will see returns. This is money that will be recouped.</p><p>Not many
projects will fall under this description, but this is one of them.
Another project is the ring road around Moscow. We need to create
extra transport capacity around the city in order to ease
the traffic burden on Muscovites, as well as to secure
economic growth. I believe this is an important project that has
already received around 150 billion. </p><p>Also,
there is funding for Rosatom’s nuclear power station in Finland. This is an absolutely safe
investment because Finland has a stable economy. Despite all
the sabotage there, the parliament made a firm decision
to support this project, which was honestly very surprising to me.
Rosatom’s partner, a company operating in Russia, has invested
billions of euros in our economy and has expressed
a willingness to cooperate and take on the risks. This
money will be recouped by all means. This is a good investment.</p><p>Next, some
of the money, I think around 180 billion, was invested
in the Russian Direct Investment Fund. This fund raises ten foreign
dollars for each invested dollar. This is an efficient investment.
There have been no other serious investments from the National Welfare
Fund but we will think about more opportunities that will be at least
as efficient as those in the above projects.</p><p>”Oil“. Now
let’s talk about oil.</p><p><b>Natalya
Menshikova:</b> Good afternoon, Mr Putin. Natalya Menshikova, Nizhnevartovsk
District TV channel, which is in Yugra, the home
of the Samotlor oil field. The bulk of Russian oil is
produced in our region, but these oil fields were originally explored back
in the 1970s. This brings me to my question: do you plan
to invest in exploration, and if so, when? Also, pensioners from
the Nizhnevartovsk District would like to wish you a Happy New Year.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Thank you. Please convey my thanks not just to the pensioners
but to everyone in your region. I thank you for your
support. Despite the problems facing them, and these are people with modest
incomes, they are one of the most responsible groups in our
society. These people – many of them – suffered many hardships
after the war and worked very hard to rebuild our economy; they
have seen a lot, and now they have only the state to rely
on. </p><p>We know
this, and we are grateful to them for their patriotism
and their readiness to contribute to the education
of the rising generation. They are doing this, and I mean
not only Great Patriotic War veterans but all veterans, including veteran
workers. Happy New Year to you! I wish you health and all
the best. Thank you! Let’s applaud, no, not to me but to this part of our country. <i>(Applause)</i></p><p>As for geological
exploration, it is a major part of our future. As you know, we
adopted decisions on sour crude oil several years ago towards a more
effective use of the depleting oil fields. We also adopted several
other decisions, including decisions on taxation.</p><p>I know
that the oil companies are not entirely satisfied, because we envisaged
the so-called tax manoeuvre, under which we promised to reduce
the export duty on crude oil while increasing the mineral tax.
But this decision was not implemented, although we raised the mineral tax
on oil and gas. The Government has increased the burden
[on oil companies]. It is important that this situation does not last
forever, and I agree with some in the industry who say that
the oil companies are moving forward under their own momentum, when they do
not reduce production, as I said. They do not revise their
development plans, and they have even increased production, as I have said.</p><p>At the same
time, we, meaning the Government, must look closely at developments
in this sector so we do not kill the goose that lays the golden
eggs. We will analyse the situation very seriously. Exploration is
a highly important part, but the situation is not quite as you
described it, that nothing has been done in exploration since
the 1970s. No, we have been working on it, and we have invested
in the agencies that have been charged with this work
at the Government.</p><p>We try
to encourage both private and state-owned companies to do this,
and they have been doing it. I cannot cite figures now, but
I can tell you that they are quite impressive. Maybe we are not doing enough,
but I assure you that we have never neglected this.</p><p><b>Veronika
Kilina: </b>Thank you very much for this opportunity to ask
a question. </p><p>Good
afternoon, Mr President. </p><p>Veronika
Kilina with Nakanune.ru, a news agency based in the Urals
Federal District. </p><p>Do you
support the idea of the serial production of Il-96 planes
and do you think that the strong imbalance in favour of foreign planes was
wrong, especially in view of the recent tragic events? Why do you
prefer domestically manufactured planes? I am referring
to the presidential air group that operates the Il-96. Thank
you. </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>You know, I completely share your concern. The aircraft manufacturing
industry is one that ensures the development of the high-tech sector
of our economy. This is what we inherited from the Soviet era. Although
of course, the Soviet Union developed primarily military aviation,
adapting it later to civilian needs. They did not care about
the lifespan or fuel consumption in civilian aircraft. </p><p>We cannot
follow the same approach today but we should definitely not only provide
domestic carriers with our own aircraft but also enter the international
market. Generally, we should direct our manufacturers, including aircraft
manufacturers, to ensure a level of quality that will make them
competitive throughout the world.</p><p>Regarding
a wide-body plane, this simply requires substantial investment. We have
agreed with our Chinese partners to do this together and we are following
this path. This is what I would like to tell you. These are large,
wide-body, long haul planes. However, this is not enough for us. We need
to provide planes not only for long-range routes but also regional
routes, regional carriers. There are plans – I believe
the Il-114, an old forgotten project, of course, with
the innovation and new technology that is possible and necessary
for a modern product. </p><p>As you
know, a major event has happened in engine manufacturing.
The new PD-14 engine is the first product of its kind since
the late 1980s. Somehow, we do not pay attention to this, but it is
a major achievement for our engine makers. I said this at a meeting and now I will take this opportunity to congratulate them
on this accomplishment and thank them for their effort. This
enables us to develop our aircraft industry further, including
the Il-96 you mentioned. </p><p>The energy
efficiency of the new engine and its capabilities make it
possible for us to develop an entire line of planes, both
medium-haul and long-haul. By the way, this was our weakest
spot. I believe we can deal with avionics but this was the weakest
spot, so we had to use either Pratt and Whitney or Rolls Royce.
Their engines are good but ours are better. And our planes will also be
better. </p><p><b>Vladimir
Kondratyev:</b> Mr Putin, you spoke about oil, and you were asked about oil. I would like to ask you about gas – it is also one
of the foundations of Russia’s prosperity. Not everything is
clear on this issue. </p><p>We know
that actions by the Ukrainian authorities are unpredictable. This is
obvious from what happened in Crimea, where energy supplies were cut off.
What if Ukraine stops the transit of Russian gas to Europe? Here
is the problem. The talks on Turkish Stream have been suspended
because of the conflict with Turkey, and it is unclear whether
they will be resumed. It would be very helpful if you would speak on this.</p><p>We have
a backup option, Nord Stream-2 through the Baltic Sea, but
a group of EU countries has protested against its construction
and wants to torpedo the project like South Stream was done away
with in the past.</p><p>What
awaits us, and what turn will events take? By the way, what will
happen with the construction of the Russian nuclear power
station in Turkey, in which Russia has already invested $3.5 billion,
according to Western sources?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Russia has not invested $3.5 billion in the Akkuyu
nuclear power station. The future of this project should be decided
at the corporate level. This is a strictly commercial issue,
and we will not take a single step that would harm our economic
interests. But this is up to Rosatom and its partners. As far
as I know, the Turkish side has not yet issued the permit
required to launch this project and make it a priority project.
But let me repeat that this is a corporate decision.</p><p>Now let’s
talk about Nord Stream and those who objected to it. We know that
many countries were against the Nord Stream-1 project, but it was carried
out. Its implementation turned out to be extremely helpful
at the time. Not all conditions have been fulfilled
and the pipes are not 100 percent filled with gas, especially
in Germany – it is 50 percent for Opal and almost none
on another route, but I am confident that these opportunities will come in handy. </p><p>Regarding
South Stream. You know our position: we were ready to implement it, but
they simply would not let us. First, the European Parliament ruled that
this project clashed with the European Union’s interests
and forwarded the relevant document, and later the European
Commission forced Bulgaria to halt the preparatory work,
and then, all of a sudden, a Dutch regulator, where South
Stream was registered, decided to grant us permission to launch
the construction of the marine section. But how could we launch
construction at sea, sink billions of euros there and then reach
the Bulgarian coast without receiving permission first? </p><p>Naturally,
they simply put us in a foolish situation, and seeing that, we
said: if this is how it is, then we are also stopping. They did not let us, do
you understand? And I am surprised at the toothless stance
of the Bulgarian Government, which chose to neglect its own national
interests for unclear reasons. We had planned to invest three billion
[euros] in the construction itself — that means jobs, that means
salaries, that means revenues to budgets of all levels, plus they
could have had a minimum of 400 million euros per year just
for transit. Well, a no is a no, so be it. As a matter
of fact, one reason we came up with that project was to support
Bulgaria. They do not want it – well and good. </p><p>We began
discussing Turkish Stream. You know, it is not up to us in the end. Not that we
broke off the negotiations, but we want the European Commission
to provide written guarantees that all the routes, including
a possible route through Turkey to Europe, are not only feasible, but
also that it is a priority route and that the European
Commission will back it. If Gazprom’s Turkish partners bring such
a document from Brussels, we will move further. Unfortunately, so far,
this does not seem to be the case. </p><p>Regarding
transit through Ukraine. True, at a corporate level, I heard it
myself, during very serious debates someone would say: we will cut off this
transit completely. I am not sure this should be done –cut off
transit through Ukraine. </p><p> But speaking about the capacity
of Ukrainian transit and that of, say, Nord Stream-2… Well, everyone
demands that Nord Stream in general and the future Nord Stream-2
meet certain requirements. What are these requirements? Reliability,
the market nature of the gas transport system’s operation,
and legal and administrative regulations that match the highest
standards. Are our Ukrainian partners able to do what we together with our
European partners have been doing with regard to Nord Stream? If they are
able, we will continue working with them. If not, then we will see what can be
done about it. </p><p><b>Natalia
Rybyakova</b>: The <i>Krasny Sever</i> newspaper. Natalia Rybyakova. Yamalo-Nenets
Autonomous Area.</p><p>I have
a question regarding the Northern Latitudinal Railway. Thank you
for supporting Yamal projects. The regional government has also been
doing a lot in this respect. Specifically, a public-private partnership
agreement will be signed by the end of the year
on the Bovanenkovo-Sabetta section. Unfortunately,
the construction of the much-needed Salekhard-Nadym section has
stalled, and project costs are growing by the day. Can this
issue be resolved?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: There is no doubt that we need this project. Yamal is Russia’s oil
and gas pantry. We have been developing this territory and we will
keep doing so in the future.</p><p>You know
about the major international project implemented by Novatek,
and the Chinese and French partners. The Government
supports this project, among other things, because foreign investors entered
this project before us. I will be honest with you. These investments
by our foreign partners were an incentive for us to support this
undertaking. Withdrawing our support for the project after foreigners
invested in it would not have made any sense. It would have been simply
unfair towards our foreign partners who had already invested
in the project.</p><p>This is
an important project. This shows that we are thinking about
the future. What I mean is that global LNG sales are set
to grow.</p><p>Today, we
are able to offer LNG for sale only in Russia’s Far East through
the joint ventures we have, or through Gazprom’s swap deals. But here
we will have a powerful project by the Russian, French
and Chinese to produce large volumes of LNG and access
almost all global markets.</p><p>We have
the future in mind as we work on this project. I am impressed
that those who run it have been so successful. Everything is on schedule,
and the quality is high.</p><p>As for what
you have mentioned, I think this is an extremely important project, since
if we build such a huge terminal and launch extraction and shipment
operations, it would be highly desirable to have a universal port
there. This way, not just LNG products can transit through this port, but all
kinds of goods that can be rerouted from the Trans-Siberian Railway
or Baikal-Amur Mainline. This is a very convenient location with
great logistics. This could be all sorts of goods — bulk shipments,
or anything else.</p><p>As for budget
allocations, this requires additional consideration, taking into account budget
constraints. We need to look at different options, including
attracting foreign investment. The interest is there, and I hope
the Direct Investment Fund, which I mentioned earlier, will contribute
to these efforts. We remember about these projects, and are committed
to effectively supporting them whenever we can.</p><p>Egypt,
please.</p><p><b>Question</b>: Good afternoon,
Mr President, I have two questions. The first one is about Egypt.</p><p>When will
you open Egypt to Russian tourists? This is my first question.</p><p>My second
question is as follows. Two days ago, Saudi Arabia announced a new
Islamic alliance. As far as I know, this new Islamic alliance
brings together the Sunnis, and the Shiites will be
in trouble. This will be an anti-Russian alliance, and it
includes Turkey. This is very dangerous. I would like to hear what
you think about this alliance and, of course, your answer
to my first question.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: With regard to tourism, the decision to limit our civil
aviation flights to Egypt is not due to our distrust
of the Egyptian leadership. It was not a political decision.
This decision was about ensuring the safety of our citizens. We tell
our people, ”Unfortunately, the Egyptian services and oversight
and law enforcement agencies are unable to deal with the threat
of terrorism.“</p><p>Terrorists
are a threat for us as well as for you in Egypt. President of Egypt Abdel
Fattah el-Sisi has shown amazing courage in fighting this scourge, but it
takes time to resolve these problems. As soon as we come up with
the mechanisms that can reliably ensure the safety of our
passengers, we will lift the restrictions. </p><p>We are
working on this with our Egyptian partners. What would these mechanisms be
like? At every stage of airport control, from landing
to departure, we must have our employees involved
in the process. Again, we do not believe official Egyptian
authorities are at fault here. This is our shared problem and concern, so
we must find a shared answer to these challenges.</p><p>With
regard to the coalition created in Saudi Arabia. We do not think
this coalition will have an anti-Russian slant. You mentioned Turkey,
which we do not consider hostile. They have committed a hostile act
against our plane, but saying that we consider Turkey a hostile state
would not be true – our relations have indeed soured, and I am not
sure yet how we will get past this situation, but in any case,
the ball is not in our court, but Turkey’s. However, the coalition
will also include Egypt and other countries. This alliance was initiated
by Saudi Arabia. We have both different and similar approaches
to resolving the Syrian crisis, and we maintain contact with
Saudi Arabia.</p><p>I recently
met with the King [of Saudi Arabia]. We keep in touch through various
meetings organised by our respective foreign and defence ministries.
We are now considering joint projects in military-technical cooperation with
Saudi Arabia. It is a multibillion dollar programme. We are not even
thinking that this alliance may be directed against Russia.</p><p>On a separate
note, in order to effectively address the challenges facing us
in fighting terrorism, we must join our efforts rather than disperse our
possibilities. In fact, I am not quite sure what has happened. The United
States has created an alliance that includes all those countries,
including Saudi Arabia. What is missing? Why was it necessary to create
another alliance, if there is already one led by the United States?
Do they have a plan of their own? Are there any internal
contradictions? There may be contradictions.</p><p>Because
regional interests of the regional powers are one thing
and global interests in fighting terrorism are another. Europe is
suffering from the ripple effects coming from that region. We have seen
terrible terrorist attacks in Paris. The United States recently came
under a terrorist attack that killed 14 people. The threat
of more attacks remains.</p><p> We all need to join forces in fighting
terrorist organisations, no matter what they are called and whatever
slogans they may use to cover up their activities. I hope that
the recently created alliance will uphold common interests and that
we will develop common approaches and rules, establish effective cooperative
actions and agree on the tools that we will use in this
fight.</p><p><b>Maria
Gomenyuk-Kravtsova: </b>Kaliningrad, Klops.ru news portal.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>Again?</p><p><b>Maria
Gomenyuk-Kravtsova: </b>Klops.ru</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>Klops?</p><p><b>Maria
Gomenyuk-Kravtsova: </b>Yes, it is a German dish.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>I see. Rulka.ru. What are these klops – cutlets?</p><p><b>Maria
Gomenyuk-Kravtsova: </b>That is right. </p><p>Many
traffic accidents take place in Kaliningrad every day in which
pedestrians are killed or seriously injured. One such victim is our
colleague Nadezhda Rzhevskaya. She was run down at a pedestrian
crossing by a student from the Federal Security Service Border
Protection Institute. Three months later, the investigation has not been
closed and a criminal case has not been opened. The student had
his driving license returned to him and he continues to drive
his BMW, as before. </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>He must be a good student to drive a BMW. </p><p><b>Maria
Gomenyuk-Kravtsova: </b>Our colleague was seriously injured. She is wheelchair
bound. </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>Terrible. </p><p><b>Maria
Gomenyuk-Kravtsova: </b>In this connection I have a question.
Do you think high rank and shoulder boards can exempt a person from
responsibility?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>Of course not. This is nonsense. No rank, no position can. He does
not even have a position. What is he, a commander or what?
A student, a rank and file serviceman. It is simply unfair
to say that he has some official position that allows him to evade
responsibility. Perhaps some influences may be involved there that are
obstructing the investigation. I simply do not know. I promise
you that the investigation will be conducted thoroughly. </p><p>It is
difficult for me to say what happened there. In such road
accidents, such tragedies, the sides’ positions are always different.
Nevertheless, it is absolutely obvious that the investigation should be
conducted objectively and brought to its logical conclusion. </p><p>I entirely
agree with you: no matter who was driving, they must be held accountable
for what happened. Those who are at the wheel bear
a greater responsibility than the injured party, because a car
is a source of enhanced danger, and in keeping with the law, a person behind the wheel bears a greater responsibility
than the injured party. There is only one situation where
a pedestrian can be at fault in an accident – this is when
a pedestrian has deliberately caused an accident. Otherwise
the driver is responsible. He may be charged either under
the criminal code or the civil procedure code but he is always
responsible because he in charge of something that is a source
of enhanced danger. </p><p>Hasn’t the defence industry had enough? All right, defence, go ahead. </p><p><b>Question:
</b>Good
afternoon. I come from Tula, and Tula, as its anthem goes, is
a city of arms makers. Tula has a centuries-old history
of arms manufacturing. </p><p>My question
has to do with defence procurement. According to certain reports, it
is set to increase by 10 percent annually, but given
the situation with the oil price and the economic
situation, could it be frozen or reduced? I am raising this issue because
for Tula residents, this means jobs, salaries and, of course,
the country’s defence capabilities.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: Listen, manufacturing in general and, even more so,
the defence industry, is about long-term projects. It makes more economic
sense to complete the projects already underway rather than stop
them.</p><p>For example,
if you start building a ship – all right, Tula does not make ships,
but it does make other types of military equipment with long production
cycles – or airplanes or missile defence systems,
and invest money in the project, it would cost more
to freeze the project than to complete it. In fact, once
you discontinue financing, you have to pay for maintenance, staff,
workers, engineers, who still need to be paid, while not actually doing
anything. Otherwise they have to be let go, which is extremely risky
and should be avoided, because it will make recruiting highly-skilled
workers impossible afterwards.</p><p>This goes
to say that following through on the projects makes more
economic sense for us. All these projects are envisaged
in the State Armament Programme until 2020. Given the real
budget constraints we currently face, the lower oil price, etc. what do we
do? There will be projects, and I want it to be clear, since no
one is making any secret out of it, there will be projects that
the industry itself is not prepared to complete by 2020. These
projects will not be launched, which will allow us to save money.</p><p>As economists
and financial experts like to say, these projects are being shifted
further down to the right of the chart. Everything already
underway will be completed. The projects that will be pushed back beyond
2020 are not critical for the country’s defence capability and postponing them will free up resources and reduce the strain
on today’s and tomorrow’s budgets.</p><p>This is
a very soft approach that requires a lot of attention
by the industry and the Defence Ministry. This is why we
meet twice a year in Sochi, so that no one interrupts our work. We
sit down after making all the necessary calculations and submit
proposals. This is one of the main, but not the only, aspects
of how we work together with the military
and the representatives of the defence industry. All
the targets factored into the defence procurement programmes will be
achieved if not in 2020, then in 2021 or in 2022
at the latest.</p><p>Maybe we
should start winding things down soon.</p><p><b>Alexei
Solomin:</b> Thank you. Alexei Solomin. Ekho Moskvy radio station
and Diletant history website.</p><p>Mr Putin,
first of all, I would like to inquire about the question
my colleague asked about Mr Turchak. Please pardon me for being slow-witted; I am
just like my boss, whom you know. So this is not surprising.</p><p>Mr Putin,
don’t you think that it would make sense to suspend Governor Turchak from
office during the investigation, since his name is mentioned not so much
in the media as in the investigatory records? This has
nothing to do with acknowledging that he is guilty. All it would mean is that
you are neutral in this case, since people are unable to influence
the proceedings at this level.</p><p>My main
question is about Boris Nemtsov’s killing. We have learned from media reports,
leaks from the Investigative Committee and statements
by the aggrieved party that the investigative authorities are
unable to access two individuals who are involved in this case: North
(Sever) battalion officers Geremeyev and Mukhudinov. The aggrieved
party explains this by the possible stance of the Chechen
leaders on this issue. They could be either hiding in Chechnya
or escaped abroad.</p><p>Ramzan
Kadyrov repeatedly and publicly expressed support for the defendants in this
case. You had an opportunity to talk with Mr Kadyrov many times. Did
you discuss this investigation? What did you tell him? Did he convince you
of these people’s innocence?</p><p>And I would like to add a few details regarding children. There was
a question about Matvei, who is now disabled. According to official
statistics, Russia still has large numbers of disabled children who have
not been adopted by families. Maybe it is time to repeal the ban
on adoption by foreigners? This could also become part
of the solution.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Here is how we will work… Let’s start from the last part
of your question. I would like to point out that according
to statistics the number of disabled children adopted
by foreigners is far below that of healthy ones. No foreigner has
ever rushed to adopt our disabled children. This is statistics. So let’s
not hurry to change the decisions that we have already made. This is
the first thing. </p><p>Second,
speaking about Turchak, I want to say that, as far as I have seen online
and in other publications, their allegations are directed at his father,
and not so much at him. I do not even know much about this but I am
confident that administrative and personnel decisions, not to mention
legal verdicts, should only be based on authentic facts established during
the investigation and trial, not on press reports, despite our
respect for them.</p><p>Finally,
let’s turn to the crime against Boris Nemtsov. I knew him
personally and our relations had not always been bad. I never quarrelled
with him but he chose this path of political competition by making
personal attacks and the like. That said, I am used to this, he was
not alone. However, this does not mean at all that the man should have
been killed. I will never accept this. I firmly believe that this crime
should be investigated and the culprits punished.</p><p>You said
they may be hiding in Chechnya or may have fled abroad. It is
necessary to establish where exactly they are. I have never discussed
these issues with the regional leaders, including in Chechnya,
and am not going to do it in the future. This is
for the investigators to establish, no matter how long it takes.
You will remember the assassination of [Galina] Starovoitova. She was
also a member of the opposition to some extent but law enforcement
brought this case to a successful completion as well
as some other cases involving people that opposed the Government.</p><p>I think
such cases must be investigated by all means, and those guilty
of crimes must be exposed and brought to justice. In this way we
will be creating a stable political system in our own country. This
is more important than trying to cover up for somebody. Nobody is going
to cover up for anybody but we must wait for the results
of the objective investigation.</p><p><b>Dmitry
Peskov</b>: Mr Putin, maybe Sevastopol now?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: Sevastopol, please. Please pass the microphone.</p><p><b>Sergei
Gorbachev</b>: Sergei Gorbachev, the <i>Novy Chernomorets</i> newspaper,
Chairman of the Journalists’ Union of Sevastopol.</p><p>In Sevastopol,
the most popular toast is ”To the Commander-in-Chief!“ these days.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: Thank you.</p><p><b>Sergei
Gorbachev</b>: Regardless of the occasion, regardless of its scale.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: No need to make it too often…</p><p><b>Sergei
Gorbachev</b>: This Stalin-era toast expresses cordiality, sincerity and great
gratitude to you for Sevastopol and Crimea.</p><p>The problems
that have become apparent over the past year and a half appear
to be related to the fact that there is no definition
of Sevastopol’s role at the state level. What we have is this
counterproductive discussion at the regional level at least
about what Sevastopol’s status should be: whether it will be a Silicon
Valley, an IT-centre, a centre for tourism or recreation.</p><p>In fact,
Sevastopol was designed to be the main naval base, hence its status
as a city of federal importance, a standalone entity
of the Federation, not like Vladivostok, not like Kronstadt, with all
due respect for them, but Sevastopol. It seems to me,
on the state level, perhaps you need to confirm that
the main role of Sevastopol is not the cultivation of elite
vineyards, but the fact that it plays a special role in the country’s
defence as the main base of the Black Sea Fleet.</p><p>And one
more thing. The Navy is a conservative organisation, one that largely
depends on tradition. There is one tradition, even a privilege,
a system of incentives: when an officer is discharged,
transferred to the reserve, he retains the right to wear
his uniform, and the naval uniform also calls for a marine dagger.
However, in the last two years officers began to have their daggers
confiscated.</p><p>I have
served in the Navy for 36 years, and I do not
understand who would want my dagger with the Soviet emblem
on it. And if you, as the Commander-in-Chief, decide that
former marine officers can keep their daggers, as was the case
in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, and later,
too, I think you will earn the gratitude of thousands
of naval officers and their children, grandchildren
and great-grandchildren, who will also serve Russia
in the oceans and in the fleets.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: First, with regard to the importance of Sevastopol
and ways for its development. I find it hard to accept
the fact that from the naval point of view Sevastopol is more
important than the base in Vladivostok or even more so
the base on the Kamchatka Peninsula, which is home to our
second-largest submarine nuclear fleet with missile carriers and strategic
nuclear weapons on board.</p><p>We have
done a lot to keep this base, and we will continue to develop it
in the future. In the North and the Far East, our Navy
has direct access to the oceans. Back in its time,
the Soviet Government – and this is an opportune moment
to say a few kind words about it – did a lot
to develop infrastructure in the North, including outside
Murmansk, in Murmansk itself and in the Far East.</p><p>Our duty
is to make sure that these efforts were not in vain. We must take up
where our earlier generations left off, and take it to the next
level. Sevastopol is also an important component of the naval
infrastructure in Europe. As you can see, we equip the Black Sea
Fleet with new ships and submarines. The Rostov-on-Don submarine is
the most recent addition, though it went to Novorossiysk, not
Sevastopol, where we have created another modern, I underscore, a modern
naval base. If I remember correctly, it should have six such submarines.
As you may be aware, these submarines are equipped with the latest
Kalibr missiles, which performed very well in Syria. There will be new
surface ships there as well. The Sevastopol naval base will also grow
and improve.</p><p>Wherever
you look, there are problems that we inherited from last century. We are now
dealing with power generation. The Krymenergo equipment has not been
upgraded since the 1970s. As if there was no need to. The naval
base is the same. Much needs to be done there to develop
the infrastructure. However, saying that Sevastopol must be a solely
naval base would be incorrect.</p><p>We still
have to accomplish a lot in Vladivostok. But still Vladivostok
has changed for the better. Some time ago, it too was
an off-limits territory that was used solely as a naval base.
The city was in a tough spot: no infrastructure, no airport, no
roads, no modern social facilities, no theatres or museums. However, things are
changing. In the modern world, people, wherever they live, especially
in Sevastopol, should be able to enjoy all this, and have access
to it. I am sure that Sevastopol must be developed in several areas
at a time. How? First, it is up to Sevastopol residents and authorities.
I know there are different approaches to this.</p><p>Some want
to develop it as a Silicon Valley, as you said. Nothing
wrong with that. Developing high-tech industries instead of building
hazardous production facilities makes sense. Is it feasible? Of course, it is.
Former Navy personnel can be part of this work. They are intelligent
and properly trained people. There are many other professionals out there
as well.</p><p>Also,
Sevastopol sprawls beyond its city boundaries and it is a vast area
that can be used for building resorts and all kinds
of recreational facilities. Why not do it? It must be done. It is
necessary to do so and help people do so. We will help Crimea
in general and Sevastopol in particular.</p><p>And Navy
officers must have their daggers back.</p><p>Thank you very
much. Let’s call it a day.
