*Here are 538's final forecasts for recent elections, shown as if for a seating chat for a booking system of an airline.*

These include also the unlikely chance of none of the sides reaching 270 electoral college seats (mostly, because of 768 parity, but plausibly, because of 1 or more electoral college seats going to third party candidates). As in most years the chance appears close to 0.2%, they have been removed from the visualisation: only one seat every couple of planes would need to be reserved for that specific scenario.
