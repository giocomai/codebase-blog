is particularly gratifying, there has been an increase in <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s deposits in our banks and our financial institutions, which grew by 19. 6% year on year.","this suggests that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have begun to plan their lives in a different way, expanding family planning horizons.","it’s not about specific <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, us citizen who have adopted our children.","we know that tragedies happen but the vast majority of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who adopt russian children take good care of them and are good, decent <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","it is a fact that when a crime is committed against an adopted russian child, the american justice system often does not react at all and releases the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who have clearly committed a criminal offense against a child, of any criminal responsibility.","i have already talked about this: abu ghraib, guantanamo, where <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are kept jailed for years without being charged.","the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who have passed this law say that we have enough money to take care of our orphans and enough families willing to adopt tens of thousands of abandoned children.","first, more <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> got a better idea of what the state duma stands for.","first of all, i repeat, this is not about specific <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> but about the attitude of the american authorities to the problems that arise in extraordinary situations when children's rights are violated and criminal offenses are committed.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are different, including in the judicial system.","after all, there is another problem: <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> reject the children they adopt and the number of such cases is growing.","this should be considered by specialists, experts and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like you.","we must talk with the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who bring up adopted children.","does the government plan to increase funding for the resettlement of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from dilapidated housing?  : first of all, i want to wish you happy holidays and congratulate the miners on the record results.","and the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> living in dilapidated housing need the support of the whole country and the federal government.","i have been to such places and talked to the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and i have also seen the flats they were moving into.",") <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> working in government are experienced, many of them have worked in different ministries for several years now, but they have never been top decision-makers.","and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> should finally realise this.","the residents of mordovia asked me to convey their thanks for helping the republic organise the 1,000th anniversary of the union between the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of mordovia and other russia’s nations.","if you look at the  of the end of the world from this perspective, it will end earlier.  : so you are not afraid of this?  : why be afraid if  inevitable? : <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are saying that the french are scared and some are even fleeing to russia.","but actors, musicians, and artists are <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> with a special, delicate psychological makeup and, as we say in russia, the artist is easily offended.","i want to stress that this certainly does not mean i am against the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who care about the environment and its protection.","it is only important for there to be direct, civilised dialogue, so that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> understand what they are doing and what kind of consequences may result.","regardless of how <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> may criticise the political system in china, money is flowing into that nation, first and foremost because it is stable, because investors know they can expect that their money will not disappear in five, ten or fifteen years as a result of some kind of political shock, and this is the most important precondition for stability.","elections took place in georgia and new <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> came to power.","i do not know how to overcome the most difficult problems in our relationship, but because there are <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are willing to work on this in a professional way, let’s think about it together.","a lot has already been said and will be said about how our country and our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are changing.","therefore, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> change, things change.","this significantly increased the level of my professional training, confidence in what i do, what the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who work with me do, our entire team.","my  is: should the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of tuva expect trains on the kyzyl — kuragino line?","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> feared it.","and in the end eleven villages along the bam with a population of 4,500 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were left without any transport links, that is <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> cannot leave either by road or by plane.","there are many problems in the bam zone, and one of the most important is relocating <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from unfit housing, something we have already talked about.","russian railways decided to support local traffic primarily because it involves a large number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> working in big cities and living in the suburbs.","unfortunately, the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> living on its territory cannot purchase land, the municipal district is losing investors and therefore has fallen behind in its development.","of course, this should not be at the expense of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live in these areas.","there are many competent, knowledgeable and experienced <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the world, and one of them, for instance, is christine lagarde, who heads the imf.","european countries have very good experts in the truest sense of the word, including those working in economics and finance, and there are <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like that in the united states.","but when the decision was adopted, it turned out that there were more <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who were dissatisfied with it than those who called for the change.","but, i repeat, we must first be guided not by these considerations but by the interests of the russian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","i know that many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the academic community were critical of the project because we have many research hubs in russia that were established back in the soviet times and they are well-developed centres that have proven their effectiveness.","for years the attention of the global community was…  : the animation in the hall is inappropriate, what is meant here is the elder kadyrov, who died for his <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","we've talked about this and you know this well: the reconstruction of grozny from the ashes is a great achievement of the chechen <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","of course, it was done with the support of the whole of russia, but it would have been impossible without the direct involvement of the chechen <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","nevertheless, crimes and terrorist attacks continue to be committed and take <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s lives.","in the caucasus, the unemployment rate is 15, 20 and even 25%, and it is even higher among young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> need jobs, they need to engage in constructive work, and we must create opportunities for them to study.","you have talked about the society, but i am sure you are aware that a large part of society, a minority but nevertheless these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are intellectuals, is strongly opposed to these amendments.","there are bound to be

are very concerned about the rise in crime, especially in small towns, where it is most noticeable.","when i started to investigate this, it turned out that before the police reform each district policeman, the most direct link between the public and the police, was in charge of a territory with 3,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and now one police officer is responsible for 15,000–18,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","so when <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> hear that, they say, “how can that be?","so when <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> say, “that may be the average salary but we get less,” – yes, it may be less in their region, but  talking about the average salary.","there was so much talk at the time that in order to attract honest <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> into the police force, we must pay them more.","and maybe the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> you were talking about fall into these 25%.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were not allowed to take part in the elections, signatures were declared invalid.","these are only some of the problems faced by the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who went to the polls and did not reach the political olympus.","for example, do you know how many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> voted early in the presidential elections in the united states?","a huge number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> voted early.","most of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who have joined the ranks of the so-called irreconcilable opposition were in power in the past, and we know what they built, we know how they worked in the russian regions, they destroyed everything and their work in the federal government was not very effective either, to put it mildly.","but <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> must have the opportunity to state their position, as i said in the address to the federal assembly, and that is a difficult task for the authorities.","some of my colleagues are starting to criticise me, and i say, “well, maybe our state system, the power vertical, is not effective enough if fairly simple issue that have to do with, say, gardeners or small landowners, issue of land and land surveying that affect millions of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, mostly pensioners, remain unsolved for years.","in the address to the federal assembly i talked about court reporters, who emerged in the 19th century in russia as a well-educated class of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who knew the law, wrote well and were able to state their position clearly and intelligently.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> pay for the land they buy in accordance with land cadastral appraisal, while the real estate is still being bought based on the old bureaucratic appraisal system.","so i would like to ask, is it legal, is it acceptable for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to work until that age?  : do you want to restrict them, if an individual wants to work?","i want to thank polish <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> for not forgetting the history, for the fact that such events are being held and organised.","we mourn together with the polish <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","but naturally, we must attain an absolutely objective answer to all the s from our side and from the polish <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","but i have a , why do these channels, which are partially financed by the state or belong to companies with state participation, employ journalists who allow themselves to focus primarily on negative information about our country, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like svanidze, dorenko and pozner?","your  shows that you and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who share your position feel that, at the very least, these journalists present their positions in an unacceptable manner.","second, about the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are in prison, i do not think that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> should be imprisoned for taking part in rallies, even if those rallies were held in violation of the law.","why do some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> think that here it is allowed to tear off officers’ shoulder straps, to hit a police officer in the face or try to strangle him?","but i have to admit that i really am not familiar with the details and the names you have mentioned, on what grounds were these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> detained and put in custody for the period of the investigation, but i'll see.","the number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> dissatisfied with the government’s policy and the performance of the authorities is 55% and 45%, respectively.","do you think this may be connected, for example, with the difference in detention conditions for 18-year-old alexandra dukhanina, who was arrested as part of the bolotnaya square case, and the former state official yevgenia vasilyeva; and with the fact that, on the one hand, we have adopted – within a fraction of a second — a response law to the magnitsky act despite the fact that a large part of society was opposed to it and demanded at least to hold a discussion, while on the other hand, the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are disloyal to the authorities have no voice at all.","but just recently i heard very different speeches from the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of your circle: “how is it possible to imprison a person for an economic crime?”","they sentence <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to 99 years of imprisonment for economic crimes, and even 100 years.","but the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who scoff and sneer are those who do not connect their fate and the fate of their children to our country’s life.","how should we behave towards the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who built our country over a thousand years if not with respect?","” but <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> there are very nice, very hard-working, and we should not interfere with them, but rather facilitate their work.","do you know how many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> us law enforcement agencies seize around the world in violation of national jurisdictions, drag off to their prisons, and try them there?","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are exempt from criminal liability, and sometimes the judicial system does not even want to consider these cases.","my first  was about the millennium of mordvin <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s unity with the russian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, the development of relations with the finno-ugric world and mordovia’s pivotal role in the finno-ugric world.","what do you believe our regional team and the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of mordovia should do to make sure this world cup is not just a major image-building project but becomes a driver for the economy in a way that has an impact on every person in our region?  : first, with regard to the agenda in the russian regions and in the capital – it is true that it is a bit different.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the regions are concerned about the standard of living – that is natural.","third, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> must have an opportunity to feel in demand.","it is crucial for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the russian regions to feel fully engaged, to feel in charge, to watch the world cup, which is a great spectacle, to see their idols and enjoy life.","nevertheless, mortgage loans remain unaffordable for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> with average incomes and we must continue our efforts to lower mortgage interest rates.","however, they are growing in parallel with incomes, and the number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who take out mortgages has increased and is continuing to increase.","i have already talked about this: young families, especially <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of the so-called reproductive age (excuse me for using such professional jargon), those who are just starting their careers, find it difficult or even impossible to take advantage of mortgage loans.","we have the population of 300,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, plus 50,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the summer, minus 35,000 in the winter, and most of the young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> move away because life is hard.","as to the fact that kalmykia is no longer a highly subsidised region, it testifies to the positive development trend in the republic and shows that it has talented, hard-working and efficient <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","and if we really say that it is a fraternal nation and a fraternal country, then we should act the way close family members do and support the ukrainian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in this difficult situation.","i’d like to see their reaction.   not talking about bureaucrats, but about the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> actually out there working the land.","let me say again that this decision is not about the interests of ukraine’s current government, but is about the interests of ukraine’s <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","because yes, it is support for the ukrainian economy and ukrainian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, without a doubt, but this money comes from the national welfare fund, as you know, our reserve funds.","it is hard to find such <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> on the job market.","you can’t force <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> after all, can’t make them stay here.","but if we do not pay <span

state agencies – we will not achieve the results we want in our work.","if we have problems here, it is ordinary <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who suffer, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in industry, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who receive social welfare benefits and pensions, because the quality of these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s work is crucial for the economy’s success in general.","we can debate the quality of the hpp staff’s work and whether everything was done on time or not, but not a single expert among those who checked the whole situation has so far found any serious problems in the hydroelectricity <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s work, and we have had the prosecutors, the investigative committee, and experts all conducting these investigations.","some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> think, and not without reason, that if the hydroelectricity <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> had taken such and such a measure intended to make things better, on the contrary, it could have been worse.","you know, we have a lot of politicians, and they’re very experienced <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","millions of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> vote for the communists.","these ratings are drawn up by educated <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, by experts, but real life is far more complicated than ratings.","new <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> appear on the political spectrum, some of them are in opposition to the government, other are not.","this is a general rule of conduct for all opposition parties in the world, it is a well-known, trivial trick, and, in principle, it is the right move for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who want to make themselves known.","all in all, this is a very good process and it is right that we have more and more <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who not only consider themselves to be politicians, but think that they are in fact number one, so you should be careful about what you say.","this is not about the fraternal ties between our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s and countries, but because we have a very high level of cooperation.","what’s important for me is not to criticise western values but to protect russians from certain quasi-values that are very hard for our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to accept.","the issue is not to criticise someone but to shield us from the rather aggressive behaviour of certain social groups, which, in my opinion, not just live the way they like, but also aggressively impose their views on other <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and other countries.","a new generation of russian citizen, young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>  even know what it is.","i think that he did a lot to change the way <span

leonid brezhnev during the soviet time), among my colleagues much has changed, and he can certainly take the credit for that.","the municipal level is the level of government that is closest to the

important is earning <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s trust.","but my attitude toward the georgian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> has not changed.","even during the most difficult times, when there were hostilities in the caucasus in connection with the events you are well aware of, even then, my feelings about the georgian <span

sobyanin did not consult with me about specific <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","of course,  sometimes hard for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are not well known at the municipal level to overcome so-called municipal filters.","and this is not linked to the fact that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> criticise the authorities or not, but simply that municipalities (after all we are talking about municipal government) are closest to the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> understand what a person can do and what they can’t, what he or she is able to actually achieve and what they can’t.","but i believe that if <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have at least some real chances, you have to help them come forward and declare themselves.","firstly, when <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> take part in politics at this level, they begin to understand the realities of everyday life, where we live and where we need to go, and what exactly must be achieved.","sorry to say it but, as a rule,  <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who have stolen things themselves who usually shout like that.","but these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> must feel real voter demands, and the problems that some russian regions – or in this case moscow – face.","and also for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to see what a candidate is really offering; not just to hear him criticize the current government, but to see what he really offers, and how he wants to achieve his goals.","when <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> begin to seriously approach these issue, when they see that, figuratively speaking, there has been no road here for a hundred years, sure, you could say, “let’s build a road tomorrow!”","this frightened a lot of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and some companies even began to cancel their office parties.","and in general,  hard for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to find the money.","kiosks do not want to sell newspapers, but russia is still a traditional nation and many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like the printed word; the older generations are used to reading.","in other words, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> want to read newspapers, but unfortunately,  very hard to survive because of competition with the internet and television.","this is because <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are increasingly getting information online.","if you belong to ege critics, i am sure you would agree that the live creative effort young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> make as they sit the written exam is something very serious, called upon to enrich both the process of education and the student.","if we look at the statistics after the ege was introduced, the number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from the more remote areas accepted by leading universities has grown significantly.","the idea has already been tested in several regions, and practice shows that overall <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> disapprove of this measure; there have even been some rallies against it.","in addition, later we will have to deal with water and heat consumption norms.   : this is a very important , and a very sensitive one for many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","the government should at least develop methodological instructions to make sure that the discrepancies you mentioned do not have a negative impact on <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s living standards.","everyone understood it their own way, but all together, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> understood and knew that they must live honestly, work hard, love deeply and care for this enormous, happy land that is called the soviet nation.","there are many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are ill, and the treatment is very poor.","i am asking you, mr president – you  even need to use budgetary funds, you only need to make a gesture and all those <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like abramovich, prokhorov, and shuvalov’s wife – they often come to visit us, they are rich <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","” according to the constitution, subsurface resources belong to the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>: oil, gas, and all mineral resources.","you won’t be able to do it right away, perhaps, you might be scared – but let’s return them to the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, let’s nationalise them all, and then we won’t have this layer of oligarchs, they won’t skin the taxpayers.","next, regarding subsoil resources: according to the constitution and the law, these resources belong to the nation; the  is, how can they be used most effectively for the good of our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>?","for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who work in economics, this is clear and obvious.","it was a terrible accident with so many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> getting killed.","i paid two months’ worth of my pension to come here, but i want to help the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in my town.","you know, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have been talking a lot about the baikal-amur mainline and the far east.","unfortunately, this resulted in hundreds of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> losing their jobs; the company has cut the labour force.   : who acquired it?","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have lost their jobs, and ours is a small town in a small district.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have been demonstrating, they are going hungry, and their children are going hungry as well.","a lot has been said about how <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are leaving the far east, but we also have individuals who stay there, who work and want to work, yet they are being deprived of the opportunity to work and to bring up their children.","would it be possible for the government to provide support for these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>?","because nearly 3,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> could find themselves without jobs.","it seems that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> stay in certain positions for a long time – for example, the same <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have held the posts of the vanino transport police department head and the transport prosecution office head for decades.","we end up watching these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> act like tsars.","they are not working for the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s benefit, but for themselves, doing whatever they want in their domains.   sorry, i am getting emotional, but all of this has been pent up, and there have been attempts by your security service to prevent me from asking this .","as for whether <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> should stay in the far east or not: i think we should consider creating humane living conditions for them.","we need to figure out why, what the problem is, when <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> invested money into timber processing but are having economic issue.","if it is clear that some members of the workforce will be laid off, they should have thought ahead together with government agencies about how these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> will make a living, where they will work and get paid and how they will feed their families.","dmitry peskov: mr president, the news conference has been going on for three hours already.   : right, and i  think we should be setting any records here; otherwise, some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> may not make it home for christmas.","to be able to hear <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like you, to hear about the sore spots that the authorities should pay attention to.","these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> make a job of risking their lives.","i assure you, all sorts of things happen in any team, and even among them there may be all sorts of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, but overall they are strong guys, they would never beat up a girl.","this was the first time in my life that i celebrated my birthday with another head of state, and it had to be no other than the chairman of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s republic of china.","by the way, i would like to congratulate the chinese <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and experts on the successful experiment currently conducted in china and the successful landing on the moon of the first chinese moon rover.","at the same time, i would like to stress our principled position: the iranian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and the iranian state should be given a chance to develop their advanced peaceful technology, including nuclear technology, and the international community has no right to impose any discriminatory limitations.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are not being paid, but that is only part of the problem.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are desperate, they are ready to block federal highways or even go on the rampage at the mill’s administrative building.","but how long will the local authorities be able to restrain <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>?  : what is the name of this town?","arevik safaryan: selenginsk, with a population of 15,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","and it is entirely clear that during winter, and in general, nobody – neither the company’s owners nor the local authorities – has the right to leave <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> without proper support.","do you think this is right, or not?  : concerning the fact that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are leaving, as you said, to the northern parts of tyumen region, let me point out that living conditions there are harsh.","and, of course, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are going there to earn some money, despite the harsh conditions in those regions.","and do you think that the situation currently unfolding in the nation – the threat of prosecution, the reform of the russian academy of sciences and other problems – will eventually force bright, talented and patriotically-minded <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> out of the country?  : i do not think so.","moreover, if <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> decide to stay somewhere, it is not because of that, but because they find some kind of work there, or their family members live there and they want to reunite with their families.","our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, who are working on this – and we have engaged academic researchers and research centres from all over russia as well as foreign corporations, very large foreign firms – are interested to know the following: will the government develop any sort of additional measures in order to provide even greater incentives for the development of industrial processes and innovative production technology?","as is known, you received appeals, not from some sort of village or city madman, but from <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in positions of authority, deputies, to send troops to crimea.","the second is that one should never make arbitrary decisions; you should listen to <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> with differing points of view regarding this or that issue.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who for a number of reasons find themselves at such a high level of authority, those who are vested with the trust of their <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, should never break away from the life of ordinary citizen of their country.","you need to always be aware of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s everyday concerns and the challenges they face; you have to constantly think, day and night, of how to help them overcome those challenges.","i already mentioned that when they toppled the monument to dzerzhinsky and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> would chop off chips, even anatoly sobchak, former mayor of st petersburg, who was a true democrat, said: “revolution is a good thing, but why destroy the monuments?”","it is best, of course, not to create any commotion, not to blow <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s minds with some untimely actions that could divide society.","i did some calculations based on the number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> that resettled in the most successful areas over the past years.","it turned out that it would take almost a hundred years to resettle at least half of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who found themselves abroad.","you are right: <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> used to live in a single united country, there was no difference between ukraine, russia, belarus or kazakhstan – all were equal.","however, it so happened that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> woke up one day, and the country was gone – and nobody asked them.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> found themselves in a crisis, often without work, without any prospects for the future.","we have quite a few problems with our migration policy, but if there is anyone we need to bring back to russia – it is, of course, russians, and all <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, generally, who wish to live in our country and be part of the russian culture, regardless of their ethnic background.","there are many of these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> on the post-soviet space, even those who are not ethnic russians.","i am referring to the category of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> whom we should attract to the russian federation.","we should give priority to young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, who will live here, create families, have children and work in those areas of the economy that matter most.","however, we should never ignore local residents, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live on certain territories and whose interests we should support.","however, i  think it would be feasible to get rid of a special service that is concerned with road safety when 30,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> die on the roads every year in this country.","in some places, like kamchatka, it was even worse, and the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> realised it was a mistake, that the regions had to be merged.","however, this is the prerogative solely of the regional authorities and the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> living of those regions.","i would like to tell you that there should be patriotically minded <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> at the head of state information resources, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who uphold the interests of the russian federation.","in that case, please pay here, so that the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who work for you can benefit from your taxes, which will be spent to pay higher salaries, retirement pensions, compensation for military service members, to upgrade our defence capacity and our law enforcement system.","natural population growth in the first 10 months of the year was 37,100 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","in this case, we will need to focus on assistance to those <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who really need it and on retaining – this is something i would like to highlight – retaining all our social targets and plans.","mr president, i believe many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were looking forward to seeing you here at this news conference.","as for excessive red tape, i can say this: there must be some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from the european union here.","i believe that this path has absolutely no future whatsoever and is detrimental to ukraine’s statehood and its <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","and, of course, we will help the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, as we are doing now (as you may know, a tenth humanitarian convoy has been sent).","after all, we should proceed from the fundamental principles of international law and from <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s right to decide their fate on their own.","and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> living in ukraine's southeast should be respected.","perhaps, in the end, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> will be able to agree on things among themselves.","when these lists became available, it turned out (in any case, that’s what the donbass self-defence fighters told us), that the lists from ukraine include <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who have been detained not in connection with the hostilities in southeastern ukraine, but somewhere in kherson or odessa.","nonetheless, we insist and i believe that we need to get these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> back home to their families for the new year or christmas, regardless of all other circumstances.","yesterday, they agreed to exchange 30 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","” well, you can do that, of course, but it would be nice if they could let go at least 30 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> … but these are details.","if ukraine wants to restore peace, tranquillity and its territorial integrity, the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live in certain regions of the country must be respected and a straight, open, and honest political dialogue must be maintained with them.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are concerned that as a result of the reform they will not be provided with the right to medical aid that is guaranteed by the constitution.","we should be guided by <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who use the healthcare and education services.","millions of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are waiting for the healthcare industry to improve.","what are <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> saying?","how much time do <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> spend in a hospital bed at the moment?","they are not used for treating <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>; just inefficient expenses.","it’s important that it is not a commercial but a social project that is implemented by young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and for young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","ten thousand <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>!","the number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> doing physical fitness and sports per 1,000 population is much higher there than in russia.","if we want to live longer, if we want our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to be healthy and go to skating rinks instead of liquor shops, then skating rinks must be available.","importantly, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> should spend their money on gym memberships rather than on partying with friends.","we need to create a culture where <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> practise physical fitness and sports.","he has publicly stated that there would be certain reprisals regarding relatives of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> accused of terrorism who have not yet been convicted in court.","i think today, the term “bullying” has come back into our lives.  referring not only to the harassment of makarevich, the allegations about invented friends of the junta (i know these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and  sure that many of them are true patriots of their country), or all the epithets like “yid banderites” heard on federal channels.","aren’t you afraid of such hatred in our society where some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are so strongly pitted against others?","do you think that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are still being divided into allies of yours and bandar-logs? : bandar-logs exist, of course.","generally – i won’t say always – the relatives of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who commit acts of terror know about them in the overwhelming majority of cases, if not more.","these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were savagely shot point-blank and many died later on.","under the circumstances, the head of the republic made some emotional statements.  sure that these remarks fully lived up to <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s expectations.","i would like to assure you that there has been no organised persecution of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who disagree with our actions, say, in ukraine or in crimea or on some other domestic political issue.","if there is some reaction from the public, from the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who disagree with this position, the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who have encountered this today should understand that they cannot monopolise the right to make sweeping accusations, that there are <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who disagree with their position and that they will also face accusations.","i also know that some in the russian elite, from your inner circle, who are the most well-informed <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in russia, despite all their public statements, tend to lay the blame for some things on you as the person who has been in charge of taking all the key decision in russia for the last 15 years… : what are the names?","it’s actually based on… there is no other stability as solid as the support of the russian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","because <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> feel deep down inside that we, and i in particular, are acting in the interests of the overwhelming majority of russians.","eastern europe, our neighbours, including ukraine, is not a banana republic, not even north africa or somalia, where you can stage a coup using some special tools, militants, or <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are unhappy with government policies.","by the way, the ukrainian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> need the money, but no one is going to do this on their own, only through international financial institutions.","there are no elite <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","there are rich <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and poor <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, sick <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and healthy <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","as there were some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> covered by sanctions there, the local directors declined and said they could not transfer money for dividend payments to them, and that they had to hold consultations.","many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are sending their regards and words of support to you.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are worried that the governors of yamal and yugra [the khanty-mansi autonomous area] will no longer be elected.","there is a federal law, according to which regions can be merged only based on the free expression of will of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live there.","no decision should be forced on <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from above; doing so is counterproductive.","and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s living standards, including healthcare, education and the like, also differ radically, which is bad, overall.","however, i’d like to say again that this is a highly delicate matter, especially when it concerns ethnic republics, and we must never force any unification plans on <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","only <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> themselves can make the correct decision based on their life experience and their understanding of developments in the economy and social sphere.","so can i say to you, can i ask you now, would you care to take this opportunity to say to <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from the west that you have no desire to carry on with the new cold war, and that you will do whatever you can to sort out the problems in ukraine?","this is a problem other farmers face as well, especially in vegetable growing: no one is willing to work hard, and farmers fear that very few <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> will be working in the fields, for instance, next year.","if i may, i’d like to ask you another  – <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> won’t forgive me if i  ask it – and i probably shouldn’t go back to

but <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were still taking out loans.","because it is important for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, for delivering on our social commitments related to provision of housing, as well as for the economy, since some 30–35 percent of the proceeds from mortgage loans are channelled directly into the construction industry, which has a high multiplier effect for many other industries.","this is a very important segment for the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and the economy.","it’s a specific and completely local issue, but  very important for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","as before, we will seek a balanced solution without impositions from the outside (this is very important) in order to let <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> come to terms on their own.","in europe, too, it was far from an easy ride in relations between different countries and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s.","there are 1. 3 billion <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> living in china.","this is definitely influencing relations between the russian federation and the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s republic of china.","what can russia offer in this regard? : you know, as with southeastern ukraine, the issue is to come to terms with the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live in these regions.","you know, i understand that this is the pain of georgia, of the georgian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and that it is a bleeding wound.","it’s simply the way it is, and it is necessary to come to terms with these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","when the lives of absolutely innocent <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> – traffic police, teachers and journalists – are not respected, when your comrades-in-arms are killed, when a traffic police officer who was simply doing his job is killed, leaving behind four orphaned young daughters (two of them have cerebral palsy) and a pregnant wife, and when the head of the republic is one hundred percent sure that certain families stayed in contact with the militants (not militants but terrorists, there aren’t any militants anymore)… when these families were asked to help bring these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in, they wouldn’t do it.","and he says that these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>

war.","but when we started doing it, there turned out to be hundreds of thousands of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","i hope to stick to it in the future and that it will continue to have positive results, not so that they will be recorded on paper, but for the benefit of the nation and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","i would like to ask you whether you consider certain categories of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to be russia’s enemies, namely heads of state corporations who first ask to borrow trillions from the

#FFFF00'>people<\/span> who work in our large companies make good money.","are there any indications of some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> going overboard, so to speak, in what they do?","you have mentioned some of these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> wonder why this is happening.","many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> understand this.","this past spring, you signed an executive order on the rehabilitation of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s deported from crimea – however, local authorities are not making any real effort to implement this order.","we have announced the political rehabilitation of all <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s who were repressed – crimean tatars, germans, greeks, armenians, bulgarians – all those who were repressed.","we also announced – and this was adopted at the federal level, since you mentioned the order – that all major languages spoken at the peninsula – russian, ukrainian and crimean tatar – are now official, which is unprecedented in the history of the crimean tatar <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","this is also a serious thing that concerns the feelings of the crimean tatar <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and their seeing themselves as full citizen of the russian federation.","i am aware that this is complicated and that crimean tatar <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> aren’t the only ones living in crimea.","but i believe – and i ask those living in crimea to hear and understand me – repressed <span style='background-color:

<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s: building roads, kindergartens and other public services.","we must work our hardest for the sake of and in the interests of the russian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and then look at the results of this work and at the public sentiment to decide who should run in 2018.","but our biggest priority is to guarantee

<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the upcoming period.","this is a very good figure that speaks of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s state of mind, shows that they have the opportunity to plan their families, which makes me very happy.","can any changes in the government line-up be expected? : well, as you may know or could have noticed throughout the years i’ve been in office, i a) value <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> highly and b) believe that staff reshuffles, usually, but not always, are to be avoided and can be detrimental.","the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of tatarstan will not forgive me if i do not ask you these s.","in your address, you said – you stressed, actually – that the kind, hard-working <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of turkey and the ruling elite should not be put on the same plane and that we have a lot of reliable friends in turkey.","and allow me to ask the second  or the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of tatarstan will be unhappy.","i would also like to start off with the fact that in your address to the federal assembly, you said that we should not put the turkish <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and the part of the turkish elite that is directly responsible for the death of our military personnel in syria on the same plane.","complaints are coming to the turkish embassy in moscow from students saying they have been expelled and from business <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who say they are about to be deported.","russia says it should be decided by the syrian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> while the united states and its allies insist that he has no political future.","they shot down a warplane and our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were killed.","after all, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were killed.","i want our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to hear this and i want turkey to hear this as well.","apart from the tragedy, the fact that our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were killed, what has upset us so much, do you know?","they started urging <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to join this movement.","now, regarding turkic <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s residing in russia.","i am saying “us,” because turkic-speaking <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s of russia are part of russia, and in this sense the turkish <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, whom i mentioned in my address as a friendly <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and other turkic-speaking <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s remain our partners and friends.","you know the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the caucasus always react vehemently to all issue related to their national identity.","this was the choice of the chechen <span

#FFFF00'>people<\/span> were killed in the united states − isis has made its way into the us.","at the least, we have found common ground with these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","this part of the syrian opposition, these irreconcilable and armed <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> want to fight against isis and are actually doing so.","and second, we do not have to be more syrian than syrians themselves, but since turkey’s actions have forced russia to increase its contingent at latakia, maybe we should keep that base to ensure stability in syria and the rest of the eastern mediterranean? : i do not want to answer for other <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and the leaders of other countries.","some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in europe and the us repeatedly said that our interests would be respected, and that our [military] base can remain there if we want it to.","we’ve never said there are no <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> there who deal with certain matters, including in the military area, but this does not mean that regular russian troops are present there.","second, you mentioned two or three <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> you propose exchanging and then offered a long list of persons to exchange them for.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are being held on one side and those held on the other should be released.","this applies above all to <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from donbass, southeastern ukraine, and ukrainian servicemen who were detained in these territories.","it’s no secret that the ukrainian authorities regard all those detained and held in donbass as <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are subject to exchange while those who are held in kiev prisons are considered criminals and therefore outside the scope of this exchange.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in donbass  agree with this.","on the contrary, we are interested in resolving this conflict as soon as possible, but not by way of physical annihilation of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in southeastern ukraine.","are they so reluctant to take into account the sentiments and expectations of their own <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>?","and we are willing to influence <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in the southeast of the country and persuade them to accept a compromise.","thousands of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are involved.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from all over the country are worried about matvei’s fate.","no matter how much money is allotted to it, there will always be <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who will be criminally negligent in fulfilling their duties.","moreover, several <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> (not one, two or three), several families not only want to adopt matvei but are fighting for him.","our best achievements are higher incomes for the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and a stronger economy, which has grown by nearly 100 percent.","for example, a drive to the nearest moscow suburb and back costs 1,000 rubles, more than a small amount for most <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","and parking is free for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live in the buildings next to these car parks.","if some <span style='background-color:

#FFFF00'>people<\/span> say that while it must be installed on new trucks free of charge, money is charged for installing it on used trucks.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> hoped that russia would ease visa restrictions for georgians or make travel visa-free altogether but there is no progress on this either.","i think this is simply a slap in the face of the ukrainian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","we will not only organise you – we will send <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who will administer over you, <span

out of 45 million <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>?","this is simply a slap in the face of the ukrainian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","as for georgia’s territorial integrity, this is primarily up to the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of georgia, south ossetia and abkhazia.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in small towns and villages have to make a very difficult decision every month: should they spend their pension or salary on mandatory payments and then try to live until the next pay day or not?","the trouble is that the authorities claim that the average salary in their town or village is 20,000, 30,000 or even 40,000 rubles, while the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> say many of them receive between 7,000 and 8,000 rubles.","maybe there is a mechanism for doing this, and if not, one should be created, so that rent, electricity, gas and water fees do not exceed a certain share of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s income, which has been decreasing?","you make interesting, substantive and solid shows in response to <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s s; you ask sharp s and try to find answers to them.","they concern housing and utility fees, <span style='background-color:

cooperation between countries and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s.","we showed how many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> love football in our country and how we planned to develop it.","this is poison for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","but why some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who suffer from certain

agro-industrial sector, but only 20 received those 1. 5-million-ruble start-up grants.","an opportunity to work and receive a pension in the soviet union was granted only to <span

closer look at the decision and inform your readers, but i think that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> will hear it now.","and of course, his pension will be indexed the same as

style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> on the street keep telling me that i mean well but that it would eventually hurt the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","the number of working <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who contribute to the pension system is decreasing, while the number of pensioners is increasing.","what i want to say and

style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, ”unfortunately, the egyptian services and oversight and law enforcement agencies are unable to deal with the threat of terrorism.","the united states recently came under a terrorist attack that killed 14 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","all it would mean is that you are neutral in this case, since <span

innocence?","she was also a member of the opposition to some extent but law enforcement brought this case to a successful completion as well as some other cases involving <span

sevastopol, should be able to enjoy all this, and have access to it.","they are intelligent and properly trained <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","it is necessary to do so and help <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> do so.","the idea is to take a differentiated approach, apply tougher requirements, closer to the basel iii, to big banks and banks that play a central role in the system overall, including regional banks, and apply less stringent requirements to small regional banks working with small and medium business and with ordinary <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","it is not surprising that officials, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who held official positions, including in law enforcement agencies, sometimes commit crimes, even very serious crimes.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in crimea and sevastopol differ on the losses and achievements of that period.","there is a problem with personnel training, because <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have never used such equipment.","we saw the expression of popular will, when <span

among other things, against the old establishment, the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> they have become sick and tired of.","i do not take support for the russian president among a large part of republican voters as support for me personally, but rather see it in this case as an indication that a substantial part of the american <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> share similar views with us on the world’s organisation, what we ought to be doing, and the common threats and challenges we are facing.","it is good that there are <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who sympathise with our views on traditional values because this forms a good foundation on which to build relations between two such powerful countries as russia and the united states, build them on the basis of our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s’ mutual sympathy.","it seems to me that reagan would be happy to see his party’s <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> winning everywhere, and would welcome the victory of the newly elected president so adept at catching the public mood, and who took precisely this direction and pressed onwards to the very end, even when no one except us believed he could win.","but my real hope is for us to build business-like and constructive relations with the new president and with the future democratic party leaders as well, because this is in the interests of both countries and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s.","such <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> must be recognized somehow, because they have literally invested millions, hundreds of millions of rubles – and by provincial standards you can imagine that this is a lot of money.","these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s motivation should be of interest and relevance even at the federal level, to the federal government and

<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like this.","just as culture, sport should be free from politics, because sport and culture should both help bring <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> together instead of driving them apart.","because you can see just about anything there from all kinds of shows and glamour which destroys young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s minds.","that is, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> would be healthier.","naturally, we must provide raw materials for the timber industry as well as

early.","we hear about a growing number of cases in which these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, including teachers and medical personnel, have to turn to the courts to defend their right for an early retirement.","we applied a one-size-fits-all approach, and many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> pointed to this, and said that this was unfair.","there are very many groups of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are allowed to retire early.","last year you said that it was never a secret that you had sent <span

to release <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> detained by both sides.","in fact, ukrainian authorities consider the detention of <span style='background-color:

consider to be lawfully convicted, and refuse to put them on the exchange lists.","if we are to have this exchange, there should be a decision to pardon these <span style='background-color:

country.","perhaps it was done deliberately so as to let <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in particular states keep hold of their privileges.","this is the american <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s own affair, however, and not our business.","in one of his interviews after the match, karyakin expressed the hope that there will be the same kind of attention and support for chess not only at major sporting events but day to day, that chess for children and young <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> will be supported and the white rook tournament will get a boost.","thank you.   : regarding the name of the bridge, as i said, whatever <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> call it, that will be the

to ask the s that, in your opinion, are of concern to our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and society.","do you have any plans to merge regions, as <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are saying right now?","this is a matter of grave concern for many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.  : first, i think there are no serious problems with the ethnic issue, as you put it.","when <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> know their national language, which is very important, and i will talk about this later, but have a poor knowledge of the dominant spoken language, the russian language, which is the tuition language at our universities, this is not good for the children who live in tatarstan.","however, i want to say this now so that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in tatarstan and other national republics and autonomous regions will hear me: we will not impose our views on the regions.","any <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, big or small, must be free to choose an acceptable and the best possible way to coexist with the other russian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s.","of course, some younger <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> do not remember or do not even know what was happening here in the 1990s and the early 2000s.","when we talk about the opposition, it is important to not just make noise out there on public squares or behind the scenes, and talk about a regime that is against the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","of course, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are dissatisfied with many things today and it is their right to be dissatisfied because our results could have been better.","an agenda that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> would believe in.","with regard to this issue – it is technical, but still important – i would like, of course, to see <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of authority who are well known across the country, who, i reiterate, sincerely support the policy pursued over the past few years.","mr president, a lot of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> come to your annual news conference and the direct line event.","why, do you think, so many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> believe that asking you, the president, for help is the only way to resolve their problems?","but this is why we are holding this event, and annual news conferences, and direct lines, no matter how some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> criticise them or say that they are too formal.","this is the feedback we need, when <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> can directly reach national leaders.","” however, even today business<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> continue to say that, if an official, a security officer or a semi-official goes after their company, they do not stand a chance, be it small or large business.","this affects primarily ordinary <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> – owners of dachas, garden plots, and those who live in villages.","we must always be mindful of the interests of the indigenous <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>s of the north.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> highlighted this issue from the outset, but those who initiated this reform promised a balanced approach.","i am talking specifically about the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> entitled to the 10,000 ruble subsidy.","because first, these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> already receive benefits linked with flats and homes.","do you work with <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> in culture and the arts, as well as researchers in this area?","the proponents of raising the retirement age are saying that if we do not do so then, taking into account the increase in life expectancy, the number of workers will decrease, and the number of retired <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> will increase, which will not allow us to properly balance the pension system.","what are we going to do with the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who will be thus freed from work?","will <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who covered up for rodchenkov be punished? : this is a highly relevant .","yes, this was a mistake of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and agencies that brought him there.","you cannot work with <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who try to commit suicide for whatever reason.","this goes to say that you cannot make decisions based exclusively on the testimony of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like that.","of course, the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who put him there made a mistake.","this should be done by his electorate, the american <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","i hope that he does and that we will eventually normalise our relations to the benefit of the american and russian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and that we will continue to develop and will overcome the common and well-known threats, such as terrorism, environmental problems, weapons of mass destruction, crises around the world, including in the middle east, the north korean problem, etc.","there are many things we can do much more effectively together in the interests of our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> than we are doing them now.",") you know that all this was invented by the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who stand in opposition to mr trump to present his work as illegitimate.","it seems strange to me, and i mean it, that the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are doing this do not seem to realise that they are damaging the internal political climate in the country, that they are decimating the possibilities of the elected head of state.","this means that they do not respect the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who voted for him.","but this is standard international practice when a diplomatic representative and even government members meet with all the candidates, their teams, when they discuss various issue and development prospects, when they want to understand what certain <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> will do after assuming power and how to respond to this.","nevertheless, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> continue to criticise the central bank, although inflation targeting was among this year’s main trends.","earlier, many <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> were skeptical that it would be possible to reduce inflation, but the central bank has accomplished this.","that is, those <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who have brought their financial institutions to the brink do not get any money.","today both business <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and citizen are absolutely sure that the authorities have taken time out before the elections – it is clear why – and then there will be large-scale tax hikes.","they are already going up on the sly anyway, indirectly affecting both business <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and the citizen.","if i am not mistaken, as many as 42 million <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have this kind of tax debt, which amounts to 41 billion.","maybe some of my liberal opponents will criticise me for what i will say, but i believe that we should grant relief to these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","moreover, this should be done with minimal red tape, without <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> having to come to the tax authorities.","this is another 15 billion rubles and about three million <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, 2. 9 million in fact.","these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> should be relieved from liabilities of this kind.","this is the case for another three million <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, and their tax liabilities are also in the billions.","what can be done to balance the poor regions with the so-called donors so that neither would feel deprived and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> had equal quality of life across the country?","we believe that, as you rightly noted, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, wherever they live in russia, must have a similar quality of live.","but it is not the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>’s fault that they live in regions that are not self-sufficient.","thank you.   : you are such interesting <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","they seem to be intelligent <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","we are only closely familiar with your buryat <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","earlier, you said that you never concealed the fact that you are sending <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to donbass to address military issue.","as a matter of fact, everything is clear here, and our army knows what to do with these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","this is not so difficult, because ukrainians do not leave their <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> behind.","in fact, your <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are addressing issue there engage in carnage of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of donbass, and you should not be afraid of it, because liberated ukrainian cities such as slavyansk and mariupol are enjoying a wonderful peaceful life.","and, as is known, part of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> did not agree and started resisting.","we believe this meets the interests of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live on that territory because if they do not have such an opportunity, the massacre you mentioned, carried out by so-called nationalist battalions, will be even worse than in srebrenica.","the osce turned down this idea right away saying that they have neither the experience nor the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and they do not want to give their employees weapons because they will immediately become targets for radicals on both sides.","innocent <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are suffering.","because true soldiers are there to protect their <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> and the country from external aggression, not from domestic conflicts, even a tough and complicated conflict like the one in donbass.","with the approval of ukraine (it was their proposal, after all), medvedchuk brought us the list of 67 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from one side in exchange for around 300 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from the other side.","i think that what saakashvili is doing is a slap in the face to both the georgian and ukrainian <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","in this sense our historical, spiritual and other roots entitle me to say that basically we are one and the same <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","in the 19th century some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> started saying that ukraine ought to be independent and self-sufficient.","the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of crimea made their own decision, i am sure we will get over this.","some <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> believe that it is better for ukraine to develop as an independent state.","if <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> believe so, this should be done and supported.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of different ethnic origin and religion are increasingly drawing closer to each other.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> themselves are picking what should be done under these programmes, i am speaking of the municipal initiatives programme and a comfortable urban environment.","despite the lack of prerequisites for it, i would very much like to ask to continue financing such programmes as <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> need them very much.","recently, in the past few years, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have often complained about utility rates going up, the lack of quality in the services they are provided.","this is another company of the ministry of defence which is leaving <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> with 50,000 ruble bills on their hands.  : your concern about military towns is understandable.","if the army leaves a place, it does not mean that the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> should be left behind.","and by developing, make the life of its <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> better.","and, of course, there are hints that not you personally but your <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> provoked or staged this disaster.  : listen, we are tired of this bluffing, just sick and tired.","become mature, meet the requirements of today and the interests of the polish nation and the polish <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","what are the chances of finding and taking out the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> pulling the strings of these terrorist groups?","arslan khasavov: i was born in chechnya, but that is another story.  : only chechen <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> can travel there on foot.","but i am not afraid of using these clichés: all <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of goodwill around the world should understand that if we do not resolve this together, it will be their problem as well.","i believe i already mentioned that it was my initiative to send <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> from the north caucasus as policemen there, because they are mostly sunni, and the local sunni population trusts them.","the authorities trust them too, because they are russian servicemen, and the local <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, regardless of their political affiliations, also trust them, because they are sunnis.","as far as i know, there are two dialysis centres in orenburg region, but the region occupies a vast area and it is so difficult for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to brave the frost or a blizzard… i mean that everything is geared to money or economic sense.","does this mean that russia cannot provide proper treatment (i am talking about cancer, too), so that <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have to leave to get treatment abroad?","for all the need to modernise the system, and the fairness of the remark that hospital beds are used not to treat patients, but for prevention and wellness, and although the technical equipment should be such as to reduce the time a patient spends in a hospital bed and the number of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> passing through this bed should increase, still considering the huge territory of our country reducing the number of medical facilities is not always justified.","it is the preservation (wherever possible) and creation of new forms of medical care in small communities of between 100 and 2,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","in communities with less than 100 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, mobile medical assistance centres should be set up.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are gravely ill, thank god, are not passing away, but their numbers are growing and the amount of money allocated is insufficient.","in one, there is a true repressive machine working, where criminal cases are being initiated for social media reposts and text messages, and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are thrown in jail on groundless charges, which has been confirmed by the echr, oleg navalny, and alexei malobrodsky, who is kept in pre-trial detention facility, while kirill serebrennikov’s case is being heard.","your press secretary, dmitry peskov, has already said that there is no opposition today; you have said today that you cannot nurture rivals, there are no <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","it is very difficult to rent a hall in russia, and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> refuse to cooperate, even on a commercial basis.","<span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> understand that to be an opposition member in russia means that you will either get killed, or go to jail, or something like that.","do you want dozens of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like saakashvili running around here?","the thing is, it was comprised of <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> like saakashvili or those you named.","on october 1, a ban on catching omul was imposed, so all businesses that operated on the shores of lake baikal were closed and <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> lost their jobs.","when you do, the machinery will spring into action and there will be answers to the s about how to help these <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.  : all right.","the same is true for omul: if it is being exterminated, it must be protected, a moratorium should be introduced for a period of time, but we should have thought about the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who are engaged in this business and have to feed their families.","as for lake baikal, the boundaries of the water protection zone have been expanded from 200 metres to 80 and sometimes up to 100 kilometres, so <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> have now automatically become violators, they cannot privatise land, houses, they must drive on asphalt roads.","it concerns 130,000 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, these are four districts.","everything must be done with common sense and so as not to disturb the normal life of the <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who live in these territories.","because even though do we not know each other very well – we met in passing only twice, and i believe we spoke on the telephone twice – generally speaking, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who do what our voters have entrusted us to do should have a good working relationship.","however, taking all these delicate aspects into account, we act on the assumption that there is nothing to prevent us from developing our relations with the kurdish <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","in the 1960s, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> of more than 100 various nationalities, various religions, came to nizhnevartovsk district.","a big goal united <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>.","its residents are <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> who committed a heroic feat – produced oil.","we have an economic directorate there, which is headed by andrei [belousov], and it is efficient; very professional <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> work there, and we try to oversee this.","third, as you know, in 50 regions of the russian federation, <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> receive monthly child benefits for their third and subsequent children until children are three years old.","the release of some 100 <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span>, including russian and kazakhstani nationals, has already been secured.","you see, our <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> are suffocating, really.","second, we have allowed not only far eastern residents but also <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> living in other parts of russia to acquire this hectare.","however, step by step, we will fix these problems and enforce order, which is necessary for <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to live a normal life.","now, what needs to be done to overcome these difficulties, and to allow <span style='background-color: #FFFF00'>people<\/span> to look more broadly at the opportunities provided by our mutual integration."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n
