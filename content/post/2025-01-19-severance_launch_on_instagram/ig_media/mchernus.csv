From 1991-1995, I took drama classes at the Beck Center after school and on weekends. But it was so much more than that. During my time as a student at the Beck Center, I made lifelong friends, found a community of people (other kids like me) who I felt safe with & supported by, and I was set out on a path of artistic development that I am still on today.

Arts education for children and teens is so important. And, sadly, it is often undervalued and underfunded these days. Through studying drama and making theater at a young age I learned valuable life skills like collaboration, improvisation, creative thinking, teamwork, and self expression. My self confidence grew and my imagination expanded. But, perhaps most importantly, my empathy muscle began to grow. By inhabiting the life of a character in a play I learned how to see the world through someone else‚Äôs eyes. Walk a mile in their shoes, so to speak.

I owe a huge debt of gratitude to The Beck Center and it‚Äôs arts education programming. I simply would not be the person that I am today without Beck.

This is Beck Center‚Äôs 90th anniversary season. Last night I got to attend their annual Spotlight Gala with my parents, Dick & Barb, at gordongreenevents. It was a sweet and special evening for us. And I hope a lucrative fundraising event for beck.center! If you are looking for an arts education non-profit to support please consider making a tax deductible donation to this incredible place.

National Dog Day is celebrated August 26th annually and was founded in 2004 by¬†Animal Rescue Advocate,¬†Colleen Paige, to bring attention to the plight of animals around the globe and encourage adoption.
‚Ä®The date of August 26th is significant, as it's the date that Colleen's family adopted her first dog ""Sheltie"" from the local animal shelter, when Colleen was 10 years old.
‚Ä®National Dog Day celebrates all dogs, mixed breed and pure. Their mission is to help galvanize the public to recognize the number of dogs that need to be rescued each year and acknowledges family dogs and dogs that work selflessly each day to save lives, keep us safe and bring comfort.
‚Ä®National Dog Day¬†is against any kind of breed ban. ""Dogs should not have to lose their lives because of the atrocities they have been forced to endure at the hands of man"", says¬†Colleen Paige. ‚ÄúWhile we feel that American's have the constitutional right to purchase a pure breed dog, we strongly discourage buying dogs from pet stores supplied by puppy mills, backyard breeders, the internet and newspaper ads. Rather, we encourage those seeking new canine companions, to consider choosing adoption first. you'd like a pure breed dog, look into a pure breed rescue in your city, to see if they might have some little furry soul just waiting to make your life complete. Another great place to find a new best friend is at large chain pet stores that host adoption drives for local shelters and rescues.‚Äù

We really appreciate all the texts, calls, messages and the thoughts, prayers, & lighting of candles for our three legged wonder boy. He is at home resting right now after a harrowing day and a half. The prognosis is not good long term. The doctors discovered a mass on his heart and removed 91ml of blood from his chest. But he is a fighter (and a lover) and he won‚Äôt give up quite yet. It‚Äôs a true gift and a blessing and a miracle that the universe has granted us a little more time together. We are approaching this soberly, with open eyes. We are most likely near the end. But we prayed and wished for even just one more day with the Jer Bear and we got it today. For now, he is home. And that is truly priceless. He even went for a little walk (photo above) and still barks when he thinks someone is at the door. His tail still wags uncontrollably when his aunt/godmother sami.fego comes to pay him a visit. He still snores like an old man. We are forever grateful for the incredible care that Jerry has received from the good folks at brookfarmvetctr guardianveterinaryspecialists and newtownvets all of whom went above and beyond making sure to not only take care of Jerry but to hold and help us humans, too. Emily keeps referring to Jerry as a meteor, a comet, who was never meant to be here forever.

The old red barn on our property was once an Antiques Store. And a super faded metal sign hung on one side of the structure when we bought it, faintly advertising the long shuttered shop. It was really beat up and almost illegible. But, ever intrepid and imaginative, Emily enlisted the help of our dear friend and local artist matt_ulrich_paint to re-form and re-paint this relic. The sign was 100 percent free hand drawn and painted when originally designed. Matt lovingly and expertly breathed new life into this one of a kind piece of history. He perfectly matched the original, and almost accidental, use of different fonts. It turned out great! And we can‚Äôt wait to hang it back on the ol‚Äô red barn where it belongs.

It has been quite a journey. From our humble roots making a few custom tees for friends in our backyard to raising over 100k for Biden/Harris and select Dem Senate hopefuls, it has literally taken a village. Special thanks need to go to the founding team members of Tiedyen4Biden: Allyson Davis, Kate Eminger, Ben Ferguson, Sam Grant, Mark Kane, Hannah Myers, Dylan Pickus, and Emily Simoness. Also, a huge shoutout to all of our outposts across the country who are tie-dyeing their hearts out right now in order to get you your shirts before Nov 3rd. They are incredible Patriots, every single one of them. Finally, we couldn‚Äôt have done it without the support of jacquardproducts bushwickprintlab kjbmarketing and kjbancsi.

It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman.‚Å£
‚Å£
Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV. ‚Å£
‚Å£
A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much. From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson‚Äôs Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. ‚Å£
‚Å£
It was the honor of his career to bring King T‚ÄôChalla to life in Black Panther. ‚Å£
‚Å£
He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The family thanks you for your love and prayers, and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time. ‚Å£
